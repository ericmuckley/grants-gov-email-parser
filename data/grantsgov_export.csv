INTRODUCTION Cognitive neuroscience is an interdisciplinary field of research to understand the neural basis of human cognition. The cognitive neuroscience program therefore seeks to fund highly innovative proposals that employ brain-based measurements in order to advance our understanding of the neural systems that mediate cognitive processes. Human cognitive science encompasses a wide range of topics, including attention, learning, memory, decision-making, language, social cognition, and emotions.Proposals will be considered that investigate a particular cognitive process using human brain data. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION New frontiers in cognitive neuroscience research have emerged from investigations that integrate data at different spatial and temporal scales. A wide range of neuroimaging techniques are employed by cognitive neuroscientists for measuring or inferring neural activity, as well as techniques for determining neuroanatomical structure-function relationships (e.g., fMRI, EEG, MEG, TMS).Electrocorticography (ECoG) and experimental interventions in human neural function, including stimulation and manipulation techniques combined with neuroimaging, have advanced the field. Additional recent methodological advances include machine-learning and multivariate analysis methods, resting-state and task-based connectomics and large-scale data analysis used to investigate and infer functional mechanisms, as well as multimodal neuroimaging and model-based approaches, wherein computational cognitive models may directly inform neuroimaging results. The Cognitive Neuroscience Program seeks highly innovative proposals aimed at advancing a rigorous understanding of the neural mechanisms of human cognition. Central research topics for consideration by the program include attention, learning, memory, decision-making, language, social cognition, and emotions. Proposals with animal models are appropriate only if they include a comparative element with human subjects. Proposals focused on behavioral, clinical or molecular mechanisms will not be considered for this program. Additionally, proposals directed at understanding low-level sensorimotor processes or restricted to model-based simulations of neural data will not be considered, unless they are embedded in a cognitive question related to one of the central research topics listed above. Investigators are highly encouraged to contact the program director before submitting a proposal regarding the appropriateness of their project for the Cognitive Neuroscience Program. Please include a one-page summary with an overview of your research and statements of intellectual merit and broader impacts, the two NSF review criteria. See the Merit Review FactSheet for more important facts about the NSF merit review process. Currently, the average award size is ~$175K per year (including both direct and indirect costs) and the average duration is 3 years. See the Listing ofActive Cognitive Neuroscience Awardsforadditional award information. Declined proposals are ineligible for resubmission until a minimum of one year has passed since their initial submission. This moratorium allows investigators the time required to digest the results of the merit review and revise their proposal accordingly. A proposal that has not been substantially revised will be returned without review asper the NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide (PAPPG).",Synopsis 21,No,9122029.0,grantsgovsupport@nsf.gov,"If you have any problems linking to this funding announcement, please contact the email address above.",NSF grants.gov support&lt;br/&gt;grantsgovsupport@nsf.gov,http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5316,NSF Program Desccription PD-15-1699,,,,,,,,,,

Projects funded by the Social Psychology Program support the NSF mission to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; and to secure the national defense. Proposals considered by the Social Psychology Program must communicate both the intellectual merit of the science and its broader societal impacts. Proposed research should carry strong potential for creating transformative advances in the basic understanding of human social behavior. Among the many research topics supported are: social cognition, attitudes, social and cultural influence, stereotypes, motivation, decision making, group dynamics, aggression, close relationships, social and affective neuroscience, social psychophysiology, emotions, prosocial behavior, health-related behavior, and personality and individual differences. Proposals that develop new theories or methods for understanding social behavior are highly encouraged. Research samples should represent substantial ranges of ethnicities, socioeconomic backgrounds, cultures, and other dimensions of human populations. Interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and convergent research approaches are encouraged. Proposals involving non-human animals are considered only if the research offers clear and direct contributions to understanding human social behavior. The program does not fund research that seeks to improve clinical practice as its primary outcome, nor does it consider proposals with disease-related goals, including work on the etiology, diagnosis or treatment of physical or mental disease, abnormality, or malfunction in human beings or animals. In assessing intellectual merit, the Social Psychology Program places highest priority on research that is theoretically grounded, based on empirical observation and validation, and with designs appropriate to the questions asked. In assessing broader impacts, the Social Psychology Program places highest priority on proposals that offer strong potential to benefit society, strengthen our national security interests, improve the quality of life, broaden participation in science, enhance infrastructure for research and education, and include a plan for sharing the results with a wide variety of audiences. The Social Psychology Program expects the methods, measures and data that result from NSF support to be openly shared with other researchers and the public. For further guidance proposers should consult Data Management for NSF SBE Directorate Proposals and Awards. The Data Management Plan should articulate how the proposed research will engage with best practices of open science. Researchers are expected to engage in open science practices, and deviations from that should be well-justified. The Social Psychology Program accepts regular research proposals, including Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) proposals, proposals for research in undergraduate institutions (RUI), rapid response research proposals (RAPID), and early-concept grants for exploratory research (EAGER). The Program also accepts small conference proposals for events (including workshops) being planned one year or more after submission. The Social Psychology Program does not accept proposals for doctoral dissertation improvement awards. Investigators are encouraged to contact a Social Psychology Program Director before submitting a proposal to confirm its fit with the scope and priorities of the Social Psychology Program. Such contact will be most productive by sending a one-page (maximum) summary with an overview of the planned proposal, which includes a description of intellectual merit and broader impacts.

This program also strengthens both empirical and theoretical economic analysis as well as the methods for rigorous research on economic behavior. It supports research in almost every area of economics, including econometrics, economic history, environmental economics, finance, industrial organization, international economics, labor economics, macroeconomics, mathematical economics, and public finance. The Economics program welcomes proposals for individual or multi-investigator research projects, doctoral dissertation improvement awards, conferences,symposia, experimental research, data collection and dissemination, computer equipment and other instrumentation, and research experience for undergraduates. The program places a high priority on interdisciplinary research. Investigators are encouraged to submit proposals of joint interest to the Economics Program and other NSF programs and NSF initiative areas. The program places a high priority on broadening participation and encourages proposals from junior faculty, women, other underrepresented minorities, Research Undergraduate Institutions, and EPSCoR states. The program also funds conferences and interdisciplinary research that strengthens links among economics and the other social and behavioral sciences as well as mathematics and statistics. The Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grants funding opportunity is designed to improve the quality of dissertation research.DDRIG awards provide funds for items not normally available through the student&apos;s university such as enabling doctoral students to undertake significant data-gathering projects and to conduct field research in settings away from their campus. DDRIGs do not provide cost-of-living or other stipends or tuition.Outstanding DDRIG proposals specify how the knowledge to be created advances economics science. Proposals for Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grants (DDRIGS) in Economics should follow the directions for submissions in the NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide (https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=papp&amp;WT.z_pims_id=5437&#8221;). The following bulleted items provide additional guidance concerning DDRIGs in Economics: Thedissertation advisor should be listed as the Principal Investigator and the student as the Co-Principal Investigator. It should be clear however that the proposal is written by, and the research conducted by, the student. To assure that the proposal is appropriate for the Economics Program, the advisor of the doctoral student is strongly encouraged to contact one of the Economics Program Directors by e-mail prior to the preparation of the DDRIG proposal. The Proposal Title should read, &quot;Doctoral Dissertation Research in Economics: ....&quot; Use a clear andconcise writing style.Reviewers will include economists from a variety of specialty areas. It is possible that no specialist from your particular area of research will be on the panel. Defining key terms and keeping your proposal free of jargon will ensure that all reviewers will be able to understand your proposal and evaluate it fairly. One of the areas in which the proposal will be evaluated is your competence to carry out the research. It would be beneficial for you to include any other information that can help reviewers evaluate how well prepared you are to conduct the research. DDRIG awards are designed to cover expenses such as travel to the research site, special equipment, and participation fees.

Research supported by this program will add to our knowledge of the underlying developmental processes that support social, cognitive, and behavioral functioning, thereby illuminating ways for individuals to live productive lives as members of society. DS supports research that addresses developmental processes within the domains of cognitive, social, emotional, and motor development across the lifespan by working with any appropriate populations for the topics of interest including infants, children, adolescents, adults, and non-human animals. The program also supports research investigating factors that affect developmental change including family, peers, school, community, culture, media, physical, genetic, and epigenetic influences. Additional priorities include research that: incorporates multidisciplinary, multi-method, microgenetic, and longitudinal approaches; develops new methods, models, and theories for studying development; includes participants from a range of ethnicities, socioeconomic backgrounds, and cultures; and integrates different processes (e.g., memory, emotion, perception, cognition), levels of analysis (e.g., behavioral, social, neural), and time scales. The budgets and durations of supported projects vary widely and are greatly influenced by the nature of the project. Investigators should focus on innovative, potentially transformative research plans and then develop a budget to support those activities, rather than starting with a budget number and working up to that value. While there are no specific rules about budget limitations, a typical project funded through the DS program is approximately 3 years in duration with a total cost budget, including both direct and indirect costs, between $100,000 and $200,000 per year. Interested applicants are urged to explore the NSF awards database for the DS program to review examples of awards that have been made. The DS program also accepts proposals for workshops and small conferences. These typically have total cost budgets, including direct and indirect costs, of approximately $35,000. In addition to consulting the NSF awards database, it is often useful for interested applicants to submit (via email) a summary of no more than one page so that the Program Director can advise the investigator on the fit of the project for DS prior to preparation of a full proposal. New Investigators are encouraged to solicit assistance in the preparation of their project proposals via consultation with senior researchers in their area, pre-submission review by colleagues, and attendance at symposia and events at professional conferences geared towards educating investigators seeking federal funding.

PFI has five broad goals, as set forth by the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act of 2017 (&#8220;the Act&#8221;, S.3084 &#8212; 114th Congress; Sec. 602. Translational Research Grants): (1) identifying and supporting NSF-sponsored research and technologies that have the potential for accelerated commercialization; (2) supporting prior or current NSF-sponsored investigators, institutions of higher education, and non-profit organizations that partner with an institution of higher education in undertaking proof-of-concept work, including the development of technology prototypes that are derived from NSF-sponsored research and have potential market value; (3) promoting sustainable partnerships between NSF-funded institutions, industry, and other organizations within academia and the private sector with the purpose of accelerating the transfer of technology; (4) developing multi-disciplinary innovation ecosystems which involve and are responsive to the specific needs of academia and industry; (5) providing professional development, mentoring, and advice in entrepreneurship, project management, and technology and business development to innovators. In addition, PFI responds to the mandate set by Congress in Section 601(c)(3) of the Act (Follow-on Grants), to support prototype or proof-of-concept development work by participants, including I-Corps participants, with innovations that because of the early stage of development are not eligible to participate in a Small Business Innovation Research Program or a Small Business Technology Transfer Program. Finally, PFI seeks to implement the mandate set by Congress in Section 102(c)(a) of the Act (Broader Impacts Review Criterion Update) by enhancing partnerships between academia and industry in the United States, and expanding the participation of women and individuals from underrepresented groups in innovation, technology translation, and entrepreneurship. This solicitation offers two broad tracks for proposals in pursuit of the aforementioned goals: The Technology Translation (PFI-TT) track offers the opportunity to translate prior NSF-funded research results in any field of science or engineering into technological innovations with promising commercial potential and societal impact. PFI-TT supports commercial potential demonstration projects for academic research outputs in any NSF-funded science and engineering discipline. This demonstration is achieved through proof-of-concept, prototyping, technology development and/or scale-up work. Concurrently, students and postdoctoral researchers who participate in PFI-TT projects receive education and leadership training in innovation and entrepreneurship. Successful PFI-TT projects generate technology-driven commercialization outcomes that address societal needs. The Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) track seeks to achieve the same goals as the PFI-TT track by supporting instead complex, multi-faceted technology development projects that are typically beyond the scope of a single researcher or institution and require a multi-organizational, interdisciplinary, synergistic collaboration. A PFI-RP project requires the creation of partnerships between academic researchers and third-party organizations such as industry, non-academic research organizations, federal laboratories, public or non-profit technology transfer organizations or other universities. Such partnerships are needed to conduct applied research on a stand-alone larger project toward commercialization and societal impact. In the absence of such synergistic partnership, the project&#8217;s likelihood for success would be minimal. The intended outcomes of both PFI-TT and PFI-RP tracks are: a) the commercialization of new intellectual property derived from NSF-funded research outputs; b) the creation of new or broader collaborations with industry (including increased corporate sponsored research); c) the licensing of NSF-funded research outputs to third party corporations or to start-up companies funded by a PFI team; and d) the training of future innovation and entrepreneurship leaders.

These awards are made for the procurement, conversion and/or up-grade, enhancement or annual operation of platforms in the ocean, coastal, near-shore and Great Lakes. Awards are generally directed specifically to support facilities that lend themselves to shared use within the broad range of federally-supported research and education programs. Most of these platforms and facilities also receive partial support from federal agencies other than NSF. This includes state and local governments and private sources on a proportional basis usually through a daily rate mechanism. The primary objective of these awards is to ensure the availability of appropriate facilities for federally-funded investigators and educators. Individual project-based facilities and instrumentation, limited to one, or a small group of investigators, should be supported through appropriate research programs as opposed to the IPS programs listed herein. The individual programs covered within this solicitation include: Ship Operations (Ship Ops) Oceanographic Technical Services (Tech Services) Oceanographic Instrumentation (OI) Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) Ship Acquisition and Upgrade (SAU) Other Facility Activities (OFA) Ship Operations (Ship Ops): The NSF Ship Operations Programprovides support for costs associated with the operation and maintenance of vessels in the U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF). Allowable costs include salaries and related expenses of crew members and marine operations staff; acquisition of minor or expendable equipment; maintenance, overhaul and repairs; insurance; and direct operating costs such as fuel, food, supplies, travel, andpilot and agent fees. Shore-side facilities and support costs are provided only to the extent that they relate directly to ship operations. Ship Operations support requests must be directly attributable to NSF-sponsored science. Oceanographic Technical Service (Tech Services): The Tech Services Program provides support of institutional technical services to enhance the scientific productivity of research programs using major facilities, primarily research vessels. Research vessel technical services include quality assurance, scheduling of technical support, logistical assistance, and at-sea supervision of the instrumentation and shared-use equipment available to sea-going researchers. This program also provides baseline operational support for the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) equipment pools (wire, vans and winches). Support of research vessel technical services and UNOLS equipment pools includes salaries and related expenses, maintenance and calibration of sensors and instrumentation, and associated travel. Oceanographic technical services support requests must be directly attributable to NSF-sponsored science. With the exception of the wire pool, requests for new or replacement capital equipment must be made through the Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) program, so they can be evaluated in panel. Oceanographic Instrumentation (OI): The OI Program provides support to enhance the scientific capabilities and productivity of seagoing research projects that use major facilities, primarily research vessels. Proposals may include shared-use instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis of oceanographic data. Typical instrumentation includes sensors, acoustic systems, data loggers, water sampling rosettes, biological net systems, coring equipment and auto-analyzers. Proposals must be for instrumentation that will support multiple research projects.OI proposals are generally submitted by the Tech Services manager whose operational funding is provided through the Technical Services Program in Ocean Science. Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE): The SSSE Program provides support to improve safety and enhance scientific capabilities and productivity of seagoing research programs that use major facilities, primarily research vessels. Proposals may include new permanent or portable equipment required to outfit a vessel to conduct oceanographic research as well as overhaul of equipment previously funded under this program including science handling systems (winches, frames, cranes, etc.), navigation and communication equipment, and safety and regulatory-related items. Requests for purchase of new winch pool or van pool capital equipment must be submitted to this program. SSSE proposals are generally submitted by the institution&#8217;s Marine Superintendent whose operational funding is provided through the Ship Operations Program in Ocean Sciences. There are enough differences in organizational structure throughout the fleet to make combining the SSSE and OI programs problematic. In addition, the average cost for SSSE requests are orders of magnitude more than average OI requests. In the interest of having similar size proposals competing against each other, the SSSE and OI programs will remain separate. Ship Acquisition and Upgrade (SAU): In coordination with interagency agreements and broader Academic Research Fleet modernization requirements, OCE periodically makes awards for the acquisition, design and construction, modification (either capability enhancement or Service Life Extension), or conversion of research vessels. These awards are dependent upon the availability of funds appropriated for this purpose and are made only on strong evidence of scientific need for a new or reconditioned vessel. Other Facility Activities (OFA): OCE supports specialized facility operations (i.e. National Deep Submergence Facility), University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) functions, Early-Career Chief Scientist Training Cruises, workshops and other facilities enhancement and developmental activities. All projects must focus on shared-use capabilities for the ocean science research community.

The program supportsresearch addressing learning in individuals and in groups, across a wide range of domains at one or more levels of analysis including: molecular/cellular mechanisms; brain systems; cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes; and social/cultural influences. The program also supports research on augmented intelligence that clearly articulates principled ways in which human approaches to learning and related processes, such as in design, complex decision-making and problem-solving, can be improved through interactions with others, and/or the use of artificial intelligence in technology. These could include ways of using knowledge about human functioning to improve the design of collaborative technologies that have capabilities to learn to adapt to humans. For both aspects of the program, there is special interest in collaborative and collective models of learning and/or intelligence that are supported by the unprecedented speed and scale of technological connectivity. This includes emphasis on how people and technology working together in new ways and at scale can achieve more than either can attain alone. The program also seeks explanations for how the emergent intelligence of groups, organizations, and networks intersects with processes of learning, behavior and cognition in individuals. Projects that are convergent and/or interdisciplinary may be especially valuable in advancing basic understanding of these areas, but research within a single discipline or methodology is also appropriate.Connections between proposed research and specific technological, educational, and workforce applications will be considered as valuable broader impacts but are not necessarily central to the intellectual merit of proposed research. The program supports a variety of approaches including: experiments, field studies, surveys, computational modeling, and artificial intelligence/machine learning methods. Examples of general research questions within scope of Science of Learning and Augmented Intelligence (SL)include: What are the underlying mechanisms that support transfer of learning from one context to another or from one domain to another? How is learning generalized from a small set of specific experiences? What is the basis for robust learning that is resilient against potential interference from new experiences? How is learning consolidated and reconsolidated from transient experience to stable memory? How do human interactions with technologies, imbued with artificial intelligence, provide improved human task performance? What models best describe the interplay of the individual and collaborative processes that lead to co-creation of knowledge and collective intelligence? In what ways do the capacities and constraints of human cognition inform improved methods of human-artificial intelligence collaboration? How can we integrate research findings and insights across levels of analysis, relating understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms of learning in the neurons to circuit and systems-level computations of learning in the brain, to cognitive, affective, social, and behavioral processes of learning? What is the relationship between assembly of new networks (development) and learning new knowledge in a maturing/mature brain? What concepts, tools (including Big Data, machine learning, and other computational models), or questions will provide the most productive linkages across levels of analysis? How can insights from biological learners contribute and derive new theoretic perspectives to artificial intelligence, neuromorphic engineering, materials science, and nanotechnology? How can the ability of biological systems to learn from relatively few examples improve efficiency of artificial systems? How do learning systems (biological and artificial) address complex issues of causal reasoning? How can knowledge about the ways in which humans learn help in the design of human-machine interfaces?",Synopsis 9,No,8092024.0,grantsgovsupport@nsf.gov,"If you have any problems linking to this funding announcement, please contact the email address above.",NSF grants.gov support&lt;br/&gt;grantsgovsupport@nsf.gov,http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505731,NSF Program Desccription PD-19-127Y,,,,,,,,,,

The CMMT program supports fundamental research that advances conceptual understanding of hard and soft materials, and materials-related phenomena; the development of associated analytical, computational, and data-centric techniques; and predictive materials-specific theory, simulation, and modeling for materials research. First-principles electronic structure, quantum many-body and field theories, statistical mechanics, classical and quantum Monte Carlo, and molecular dynamics, are among the methods used in the broad spectrum of research supported in CMMT. Research may encompass the advance of new paradigms in materials research, including emerging data-centric approaches utilizing data-analytics or machine learning. Computational efforts span from the level of workstations to advanced and high-performance scientific computing. Emphasis is on approaches that begin at the smallest appropriate length scale, such as electronic, atomic, molecular, nano-, micro-, and mesoscale, required to yield fundamental insight into material properties, processes, and behavior, to predict new materials and states of matter, and to reveal new materials phenomena. Approaches that span multiple scales of length and time may be required to advance fundamental understanding of materials properties and phenomena, particularly for polymeric materials and soft matter. Areas of recent interest include, but are not limited to: strongly correlated electron systems; active matter; topological phases; low-dimensional materials and systems; quantum and classical nonequilibrium phenomena, the latter including pattern formation, materials growth, microstructure evolution, fracture, and the jamming transition; gels; glasses; disordered materials, hard and soft; defects; high-temperature superconductivity; nanostructured materials and mesoscale phenomena; creation and manipulation of coherent quantum states; polymeric materials and soft condensed matter, biologically inspired materials, and research at the interface with biology. CMMT encourages potentially transformative submissions at the frontiers of theoretical and computational materials research, which includes but is not limited to: i) advancing the understanding of emergent properties and phenomena of materials and condensed matter systems, ii) developing materials-specific prediction and advancing understanding of properties, phenomena, and emergent states of matter associated with either hard or soft materials, iii) developing and exploring new paradigms including computational and data-enabled approaches to advance fundamental understanding of materials and materials related phenomena, or iv) fostering research at interfaces among subdisciplines represented in the Division of Materials Research.

MOUs of relevance to the Plasma Physics program presently exist with the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation, and the Czech Science Foundation. Proposals addressing topics in plasma science appropriate for joint consideration with the Department of Energy, Office of Science, Fusion Energy Sciences may be submitted to the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering solicitation. --- Plasma Physics is a study of matter and physical systems whose intrinsic properties are governed by collective interactions of large ensembles of free charged particles. 99.9% of the visible Universe is thought to consist of plasmas. The underlying physics of the collective behavior in plasmas has applications to space physics and astrophysics, materials science, applied mathematics, fusion science, accelerator science, and many branches of engineering. The Plasma Physics program supports research that can be categorized by several broad, sometimes overlapping, sub-areas of the discipline, including: magnetized plasmas in the laboratory, space, and astrophysical environments; high energy density plasmas; low temperature plasmas; dusty, ultra-cold, and otherwise strongly coupled plasmas; non-neutral plasmas; and intense field-matter interaction in plasmas. The focus of the Plasma Physics program is to generate an understanding of the fundamental principles governing the physical behavior of a plasma via collective interactions of large ensembles of free charged particles, as well as to improve the basic understanding of the plasma state as needed for other areas of science and engineering. Principal Investigators (PIs) are encouraged to consider including specific efforts to increase diversity of the plasma physics community and broaden participation of under-represented groups in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) as Broader Impacts of proposed work. Development of new undergraduate and graduate plasma physics curricula, orcurricula enhancement to include plasma physics topics in other courses, at institutions lacking such coursework is similarly encouraged. NSF recognizes that some research projects within this Program may require more than three years to realize demonstrable research outcomes. For such projects, PIs are encouraged to consult the above Program Director to discuss the possibility of submitting a proposal of 4- or 5-year duration. Some Plasma Physics-related activities are supported primarily by other NSF Programs.

The Big Ideas represent unique opportunities to position our Nation at the cutting edge of global science and engineering leadership by bringing together diverse disciplinary perspectives to support convergence research. As such, when responding to this solicitation, even though proposals must be submitted to the Office of Integrative Activities, once received, the proposals will be managed by a cross-disciplinary team of NSF Program Directors. Growing Convergence Research (GCR) at the National Science Foundation was identified as one of 10 Big Ideas. Convergence research is a means for solving vexing research problems, in particular, complex problems focusing on societal needs. It entails integrating knowledge, methods, and expertise from different disciplines and forming novel frameworks to catalyze scientific discovery and innovation. GCR identifies Convergence Research as having two primary characteristics: Research driven by a specific and compelling problem. Convergence Research is generally inspired by the need to address a specific challenge or opportunity, whether it arises from deep scientific questions or pressing societal needs. Deep integration across disciplines. As experts from different disciplines pursue common research challenges, their knowledge, theories, methods, data, research communities andlanguages become increasingly intermingled or integrated. New frameworks, paradigms or even disciplines can form sustained interactions across multiple communities. A distinct characteristic of convergence research, in contrast to other forms of multidisciplinary research, is that from the inception, the convergence paradigm intentionally brings together intellectually diverse researchers and stakeholders to frame the research questions, develop effective ways of communicating across disciplines and sectors, adopt common frameworks for their solution, and, when appropriate, develop a new scientific vocabulary. Research teams practicing convergence aim at developing sustainable relationships that may not only create solutions to the problem that engendered the collaboration, but also develop novel ways of framing related research questions and open new research vistas. This GCR solicitation targets multi-disciplinary team research that crosses directorate or division boundaries and is currently not supported by NSF programs, initiatives and research-focused Big Ideas. Proposers must make a convincing case that the research to be conducted is within NSF&#8217;s purview and cannot be supported by existing NSF programs and multidisciplinary initiatives. Proposals involving convergence in areas covered by existing programs and solicitations will be returned without review. The proposers should outline a five-year research plan delineated in two phases, Phase I: years 1-2, and Phase II: years 3-5. Successful proposals will be funded initially for two years and then each team&#8217;s progress will be evaluated based on a report and presentation that the team will make to a panel of reviewers at NSF. Teams that show significant progress during the first two years will receive funding for an additional three years.

Advances in CPS will enable capability, adaptability, scalability, resiliency, safety, security, and usability that will expand the horizons of these critical systems. CPS technologies are transforming the way people interact with engineered systems, just as the Internet has transformed the way people interact with information. New, smart CPS drive innovation and competition in a range of application domains including agriculture, aeronautics, building design, civil infrastructure, energy, environmental quality, healthcare and personalized medicine, manufacturing, and transportation. CPS are becoming data-rich enabling new and higher degrees of automation and autonomy. Traditional ideas in CPS research are being challenged by new concepts emerging from artificial intelligence and machine learning. The integration of artificial intelligence with CPS especially for real-time operation creates new research opportunities with major societal implications. While tremendous progress has been made in advancing CPS technologies, the demand for innovation across application domains is driving the need to accelerate fundamental research to keep pace. At the same time, the CPS program seeks to open new vistas for the research community to think beyond the usual cyber-physical paradigms and structures and propose creative ideas to address the myriad challenges of today&apos;s systems as well as those of the future that have not yet been designed or fielded. The CPS program aims to develop the core research needed to engineer these complex CPS, some of which may also require dependable, high-confidence, or provable behaviors. Core research areas of the program includecontrol, data analytics, and machinelearning including real-time learning for control, autonomy, design, Internet of Things (IoT), mixed initiatives including human-in- or human-on-the-loop, networking, privacy, real-time systems, safety, security, and verification. By abstracting from the particulars of specific systems and application domains, the CPS program seeks to reveal cross-cutting, fundamental scientific and engineering principles that underpin the integration of cyber and physical elements across all application domains. The program additionally supports the development of methods, tools, and hardware and software components based upon these cross-cutting principles, along with validation of the principles via prototypes and testbeds. This program also fosters a research community that is committed to advancing education and outreach in CPSand accelerating the transition of CPS research into the real world. All proposals must include the following as part of the Project Description: AResearch Descriptionthat describes the technical rationaleand technical approach of the CPS research, including the challenges that drive the research problem and how the research integrates cyber and physical components.This section must also describe how the research outcomes are translational to other application domains. Specifically, it must include: A subsection titled &quot;CPS Research Focus&quot; which describes the cyber-physical system attributes of the challenge problem and clearly identifies the core CPS research areas addressed in which the novel and foundational research contributions are being made; An Evaluation/Experimentation Plan that describes how proposed concepts will be validated and outlines the metrics for success; A Project Management and Collaboration Plan that summarizes how the project team is ideally suited to realize the project goals and how the team will ensure effective collaboration; and A Broader Impacts sectionthat describes how the research will be disseminated to a broad and diverse audience. This should go beyond traditional academic publications and includes education and outreach from the research team spanning multiple levels of engagement. Broader Impacts encompasses Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC) and Engineering (BPE). NSF is working closely with multiple agencies across the federal government, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T); the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA); several National Institutes of Health (NIH) institutes and centers including the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR), and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS); and the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA NIFA, hereafter referred to as NIFA). Proposals for three classes of research and education projects&#8212;differing in scope and goals&#8212;are supported through the CPS program: Smallprojects mayrequest a total budget of up to $500,000 for a period of up to 3 years. They are well suited to emerging new and innovative ideas that may have high impact on the field of CPS. There is no deadline for Small projects. Medium projects may request a total budget ranging from $500,001 to $1,200,000 for a period of up to 3 years. They are well suited to multi-disciplinary projects that accomplish clear goals requiring integrated perspectives spanning the disciplines. There is no deadline for Medium Projects. Frontierprojects must address clearly identified critical CPS challenges that cannot be achieved by a set of smaller projects. Furthermore, Frontier projects should also look to push the boundaries of CPS well beyond today&apos;s systems and capabilities. Funding may be requested for a total of $1,200,001 to $7,000,000 for a period of 4 to 5 years.

These groups may include women, persons with disabilities, Blacks and African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders. With this solicitation, the BPC program seeks to engage the computing community to develop and implement innovative methods, frameworks, and strategies to improve recruitment and retention of these students through undergraduate and graduate degrees. Projects that target stages of the academic pipeline through faculty ranks are encouraged. All BPC projects must have the potential for widespread, national impact. That is, they should either develop an effective practice that could be widely deployed, or they should deploy existing effective practices to reach larger audiences. The BPC program will support three categories of awards: Alliances, Demonstration Projects, and Supplements. Alliancesarebroad coalitions of academic institutions of higher learning,K-12 schools, government, industry, professional societies, and other not-for-profit organizations that design and carry out comprehensive programs addressing underrepresentation in the computing disciplines. They have a largeregional or national scope. Alliances operate across multiple stages of the academic pipeline and address one or several intended groups that are underrepresented. Collectively, Alliances serve as anational resource for achieving the transformation of computing education. Existing Alliances with documented evidence of national impact on broadening participation in computing may apply for additional funding.An Alliance Extension increases the duration of the Alliance award as well as its scope, introducing additional student groups to be reached, partners, and/or projects with the intended purpose of significant impact to the populations served. Demonstration Projects (DPs)are more focused than Alliance projects. Typical DPs pilot innovative programs that, once fully developed, could be incorporated into the activities of an existing or new Alliance, or otherwise scaled up for widespread impact. Examples include projects proposed by a single institution or those that focus on a single underrepresented community, a single point in the academic pathway, or a single impediment to full participation in computing.

As an important example, the opioid epidemic in the United States has largely been fueled by new synthetic opioids that are primarily produced in overseas facilities and distributed to the US through intermediate countries. These illicit supply chains flourish across national boundaries, both taking advantage of and contributing to regional instability. The profits generated through these activities finance ongoing conflicts across the globe. Making use of the same communications, logistics, transportation, and financial infrastructure that enable globally integrated commercial supply chains, illicit flows are now estimated to account for 4-6% of global GDP, or roughly $2 trillion annually. Moreover, these networks use exploitative labor, such as child labor, forced labor and human trafficking, to source and produce goods and services that contribute to both illicit and legal commercial supply chains. The Disrupting Operations of Illicit Supply Networks (D-ISN) Solicitation supports research projects that take a systems approach to advance fundamental understanding of how networks that traffic in illicit or illicitly-produced goods and services operate, leading to technological breakthroughs that bolster our ability to disable these networks. Major goals of NSF&#8217;s D-ISN Solicitation include: Improve understanding of the operations of illicit supply networks and strengthen the ability to detect, disrupt, and dismantle them. Support research on the illicit supply networks that fuel the national opioid epidemic Enhance research communities that effectively integrate operational, computational, social, cultural and economic expertise to provide methods and strategies to combat this complex and elusive global security challenge. Catalyze game-changing technological innovations that can improve discovery and traceability of illicitly sourced product inputs. Provide research outcomes that inform U.S. national security, law enforcement and economic development needs and policies.

Support is available to TCUP-eligible institutions (see the Additional Eligibility subsection of Section IV of this solicitation) for transformative capacity-building or community engagement projects through Instructional Capacity Excellence in TCUP Institutions (ICE-TI), Targeted STEM Infusion Projects (TSIP),TCUP for Secondary and Elementary Teachers in STEM (TSETS), TCU Enterprise Advancement Centers (TEA Centers), Cyberinfrastructure Health, Assistance, and Improvements (CHAI), and Preparing for TCUP Implementation (Pre-TI). Collaborations led by TCUP institutions that involve non-TCUP institutions of higher education are supported through TCUP Partnerships, with the participation of other NSF programs to support the work of non-TCUP institutions. Finally, research studies that further the scholarly activity of individual faculty members are supported through Small Grants for Research (SGR). Through the opportunities highlighted above, as well as collaborations with other National Science Foundation (NSF) divisions and directorates, and other organizations, TCUP aims to increase Native individuals&apos; participation in STEM careers, improve the quality of STEM programs at TCUP-eligible institutions, and facilitate the development of a strong STEM enterprise in TCUP institutions&apos; service areas. TCUP supports transformative capacity-building, community engagement, or research projects at TCUP-eligible institutions through the following funding tracks: Instructional Capacity Excellence in TCUP Institutions (ICE-TI) projects provide support to design, implement, and assess comprehensive institutional improvements in STEM education and research capacity at TCUP-eligible institutions of higher education. By strengthening STEM education and STEM education research, successful projects will increase the number of STEM students and improve the quality of their preparation. ICE-TI projects create and/or adapt and assess innovative models and materials for teaching and learning in STEM, embody knowledge about how students learn most effectively in STEM teaching and learning activities, and bring STEM disciplinary advances into the undergraduate or graduate experience. The objective of this strand is to expand STEM degrees offered by TCUP-eligible institutions or significantly enhance instructional approaches. Targeted STEM Infusion Projects (TSIP) support the attainment of a short-term, well-defined goal to improve the quality of STEM education at an eligible institution. Targeted STEM Infusion Projects could, for example, enhance academic infrastructure by systematically adding traditional knowledge to the scope or content of a STEM course, updating curricula, modernizing laboratory research equipment, developing and delivering professional development for K-12 STEM educators, or improving the computational infrastructure. The objective of this strand is to expand STEM degrees or significantly enhance instructional approaches. TCUP for Secondary &amp; Elementary Teachers in STEM (TSETS) supports in-service professional development in STEM disciplinary or STEM education content and/or research for K-12 STEM teachers in the relevant service area. Examples of project activities include, but are not limited to, professional development involving seminar series and engagement in STEM instruction and content during the academic year, structured series of summer intensive workshops and trainings, and summer research opportunities. The objective of this strand is to broaden the instructional capacity for STEM in the K-12 workforce and thereby to the entire community, and to build the capacity for STEM disciplinary or education research among participating educational professionals. TCU Enterprise Advancement Centers (TEA Centers) coalesce the STEM and/or STEM education expertise into a team, designed to support and promote the STEM goals, needs, aspirations, or interests of the chartering reservation or tribe(s). TEA Centers may address a critical tribal or community need or focus on a realm of research or design that is beyond the scope of individual research grants or that is of interest to multiple tribes. The objective of this strand is to build on the capacity developed through prior TCUP support and apply expertise to collaborations with communities in the institution&#146;s service area, or nationally. The Cyberinfrastructure Health, Assistance, and Improvements (CHAI) strand supports projects at TCUP-eligible institutions of higher education to upgrade the cyberinfrastructure necessary to conduct, expand, manage and administer STEM programs of study, including research. The objective of this strand is to equip TCUP institutions to meet the demands of virtual instruction, advanced computing, and data science opportunities. Preparing for TCUP Implementation (Pre-TI) provides support for activities that prepare an institution for Implementation-level projects. Consequently, they are available only to TCUP-eligible institutions of higher education that have never received TCUP support, have not received TCUP support within the previous five years, or are embarking on a significantly novel STEM strategic plan. Examples of supported activities include completing an institutional assessment of its current STEM instructional capacity, or engaging in conversations necessary to formulate a shared vision of what that capacity should be and how to achieve it. Pre-TI awards can support staff and faculty release time, travel, stakeholder gatherings, and associated administrative costs. The objective of this strand is to conduct self-studies and formulate strategic plans for the development of STEM instructional programs of study. The TCUP Partnerships strand provides support for collaborations that will improve TCUP institutions&apos; instructional and research capacity in STEM fields supported by NSF; attract, retain, and support TCUP students in internships and research endeavors deemed to be necessary for a complete curriculum offering; and engage partner universities to provide an academic grounding and a successful transition for students who wish to study or attain degrees in STEM fields supported by NSF. TCUP Partnerships broaden the number of scientific disciplines available to students at TCUP institution through collaborations with non-TCUP institutions. Active Pre-Engineering Education Collaboratives or Partnerships in Geoscience Education awards are not affected by this revision. The objective of this strand is the development, through instructional and research capacity-building, of academic and career pathways for TCUP students through supporting collaborative projects between and among TCUP and non-TCUP institutions. Interested teams of collaborators for which a TCUP institution serves as lead should contact the TCUP program directors. Support for non-TCUP partners must be obtained from other NSF programs, which follows the procedures of the prior Partnership strands. Small Grants for Research (SGR) strand support STEM or STEM Education faculty members at TCUP-eligible institutions to initiate or pursue research projects or programs that may include undergraduate or graduate student engagement. Awards are intended to help further the faculty member&apos;s research capability and effectiveness; improve research and teaching at his or her home institution; create and study new models and innovations in STEM teaching and learning; and enhance the understanding of diverse groups&apos; participation in STEM education practices and interventions. International research or collaborations are strongly encouraged. TCUP students may seek support for international research opportunities under the guidance of a TCUP STEM or STEM education faculty member and an international research collaborator. These awards are particularly appropriate as a means of recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientists, engineers, and educators at TCUP-eligible institutions. The objective of this strand is to support faculty research and professional development that build research capacity at TCUP institutions.

Background: On March 11, 2021, the President signed the ARP into law (Pub. L. 117-2). This law makes available approximately $39.6 billion for IHEs under HEERF, with funding appropriated through existing programs previously authorized under the CRRSAA. With this notice, the Secretary is announcing the availability of HEERF grant funds under the ARP (a)(2) SIP program (ALN 84.425M). Eligible institutions are institutions of higher education, as defined in sections 101 and 102(c) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), 20 U.S.C. 1001 and 1002(c). Allocations for these eligible IHEs will be calculated according to the formulas in ARP section 2003(2) and CRRSAA section 314(a)(2). Under ARP section 2003, grant awards under this program may be used to (1) defray expenses associated with the coronavirus, including lost revenue, reimbursement for expenses already incurred, technology costs associated with transitioning to distance education, faculty and staff training, and payroll; and (2) provide financial aid grants to students (including students exclusively enrolled in distance education), which may be used for any component of the student&#8217;s cost of attendance or emergency costs due to the coronavirus, such as tuition, food, housing, health care, mental health care, or child care. In making financial aid grants to students, an institution must prioritize grants to students with exceptional need, such as Pell recipient students. IHEs are urged to make financial aid grants to students to the maximum extent possible. Additionally, under ARP section 2003(5), IHEs must use a portion of their funds under ALN 84.425M to (1) implement evidence-based practices to monitor and suppress coronavirus in accordance with the public health guidelines; and (2) conduct direct outreach to financial aid applicants about the opportunity to receive a financial aid adjustment due to recent unemployment status or other changes in financial circumstances as described in section 479A of the HEA (20 U.S.C. 1087tt). The Department will award supplemental funds to eligible IHEs that received a section 314(a)(2) award under the CRRSAA, ALN 84.425M (identified by a Grant Award beginning with P425Mxx). No action is required by eligible institutions to receive these supplemental awards. The project director identified on the most current Grant Award Notification (GAN) will automatically receive an email indicating a supplemental award has been made to your institution. Please note that drawing down any amount of these supplemental funds constitutes an institution&#8217;s acceptance of the new ARP terms and conditions and a new Supplemental Agreement, which are attached to this notice for reference. IHEs that have not yet complied with the reporting requirements of the HEERF may receive delayed supplemental ARP (a)(2) awards and/or may receive awards with a restriction on the ability to drawdown those awarded funds (route payment status) until the institution has satisfied its HEERF reporting obligations.

Enhancing the long-term viability and competitiveness of the existing U.S. reactor fleet;2. Developing an advanced reactor pipeline; and,3. Implementing and maintaining the national strategic fuel cycle and supply chain infrastructure.Collectively, all NE-sponsored activities support the Department&#8217;s priorities to combat the climate crisis, create clean energy jobs with the free and fair chance to join a union and bargain collectively, and promote equity and environmental justice by delivering innovative clean energy technologies for nuclear energy systems.All applications submitted under this CINR FOA must demonstrate a strong tie to at least one of these three mission priorities and highlight how it supports the DOE priorities.NE conducts crosscutting nuclear energy research and development (R&amp;D) and associated infrastructure support activities to develop innovative technologies that offer the promise of dramatically improved performance for its mission needs as stated above, while maximizing the impact of DOE resources.DOE has established a Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) team, which has been working closely with the advanced nuclear design community to identify R&amp;D objectives and work scopes that may be appropriately addressed through DOE programs. Several of the work scopes contain explicit language as guidance; however, there are many additional work scopes that, at least tangentially, address needs identified in technology specific workshops. Work scopes that may be addressed in activities funded under this CINR FOA are identified in Part IX, Appendices A-C of this CINR FOA. Generally speaking, applications that offer flexibility or provision for addressing measurements, materials, and conditions relevant to private sector developers of fast-spectrum reactors (lead-cooled, sodium cooled, and gas cooled), molten salt reactors (MSR), or high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGCR) are encouraged.NE strives to promote integrated and collaborative research conducted by national laboratory, university, industry, and international partners under the direction of DOE-NE&#8217;s programs, and to deploy innovative nuclear energy technologies to the market in order to meet the strategic goals and optimize the benefits of nuclear energy. DOE-NE funds research activities, through both competitive and direct mechanisms, as required to best meet the needs of DOE-NE. This approach ensures a balanced R&amp;D portfolio and encourages new nuclear power deployment with creative solutions to the universe of nuclear energy challenges. This CINR FOA addresses the competitive portion of DOE-NE&#8217;s R&amp;D portfolio, as executed through the Nuclear Energy University Program (NEUP) and the Nuclear Science User Facilities (NSUF). NEUP utilizes up to 20% of funds appropriated to DOE-NE&#8217;s R&amp;D program for university-based infrastructure support and R&amp;D in key DOE-NE program-related areas: Fuel Cycle Research and Development (FC R&amp;D), Reactor Concepts Research Development and Demonstration (RC RD&amp;D), Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation (NEAMS), and Nuclear Energy Enabling Technologies Crosscutting Technology Development (NEET CTD). By establishing the NSUF in 2007, DOE-NE opened up access to material test reactors, beam lines, and post-irradiation examination facilities to researchers from U.S. universities, industry, and national laboratories, by granting no-cost access to world-class nuclear research facilities.While this CINR FOA specifies many of DOE-NE&#8217;s current and upcoming R&amp;D priorities, DOE-NE reserves the right to respond to potential shifts in R&amp;D priorities during Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 that may be driven by events, policy developments, or Congressional/budget direction.

The BRC-BIO program aims to a) broaden participation by expanding the types of institutions that submit proposals to BIO, and b) expand opportunities to groups underrepresented in the biological sciences, including Blacks and African Americans, Hispanics, Latinos, Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, and persons with disabilities, especially those serving at under-resourced institutions. Awards will provide the means for new faculty to initiate and build independent research programs by enhancing their research capacity. These projects might also include biology-focused research collaborations among faculty within the same institution, across peer-, or research-intensive institutions, or partnerships with industry or other non-academic partners that advance the candidate&#8217;s research program. By providing this funding opportunity, BIO recognizes the national urgency to broaden, strengthen, and diversify the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce. In particular, these awards will build capacity for research at institutions that have a primary focus on teaching and undergraduate education, or that have limited capacity for research. Projects should enable the establishment of sustainable research programs for faculty and also enrich undergraduate research experiences and thereby grow the STEM workforce.

To this end, systems are increasingly being implemented by composing heterogeneous computing components and continually changing memory systems as novel, performant hardware surfaces. Applications fueled by rapid strides in machine learning, data analysis, and extreme-scale simulation are becoming more domain-specific and highly distributed. In this scenario, traditional boundaries between hardware-oriented and software-oriented disciplines are increasingly blurred. Achieving scalability of systems and applications will therefore require coordinated progress in multiple disciplines such as computer architecture, high-performance computing (HPC), machine programming, programming languages and compilers, security and privacy, systems, and theory and algorithms. Cross-cutting concerns such as performance, correctness and accuracy, and heterogeneity must be taken into account from the outset in all aspects of systems and application design and implementation. The aim of the Principles and Practice of Scalable Systems (PPoSS) program is to support a community of researchers who will work symbiotically across the multiple disciplines above to perform basic research on scalability and correctness and accuracy of modern applications, systems, and toolchains built on heterogeneous architectures. The intent is that these efforts will foster the development of principles that lead to rigorous and reproducible artifacts for the design and implementation of large-scale systems and applications spanning the full hardware/software stack.

DASS will support well-conceived collaborations between these two groups of researchers. The first group consists of researchers in software design, which, for the purposes of this solicitation, is broadly defined as formal methods, programming languages, software engineering, requirements engineering, and human-centered computing. The second group consists of researchers in law and the social, behavioral, and economic sciences, who study social systems and networks, culture, social norms and beliefs, rules, canons, precedents, legal code, and routine procedures that govern the conduct of people, organizations, and countries. Proposals for this program must create general advances in both (1) understanding the social, behavioral, economic and/or legal context of accountable software design; and (2) improving the methodology for designing accountable software beyond specific use cases. Each proposal must have at least one Principal Investigator (PI) or co-PI with expertise in software design and at least one PI or co-PI with expertise in law or a social, behavioral, or economic science. All proposals must contain a detailed collaboration plan that leverages the complementary expertise of the PIs/co-PIs in the designated areas and describes the mechanisms for continuous bi-directional collaboration.

As such, even though proposals must be submitted to the Directorate for Geosciences when responding to this solicitation, once received, the proposals will be managed by a cross-Directorate team of NSF Program Directors. Arctic temperatures are warming faster than nearly everywhere else on Earth, with some models projecting that continued warming could produce an ice-free Arctic Ocean in a few decades. The 6th Assessment Report from Working Group 1 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlighted the consequences of this warming, including the loss of mass from the Greenland Ice Sheet, lengthening fire seasons, increasing extreme heat events, thinning and loss of Arctic sea ice, threat of ocean acidification, and reductions in spring snow cover. The rapid and wide-scale changes occurring in response to this warming portend new opportunities and unprecedented risks to natural environments; social and cultural systems; economic, political and legal systems; and built environments of the Arctic and across the globe. Gaps in scientific observations and the prevalence of interdependent social, natural, and built systems in the Arctic make it challenging to predict the region&apos;s future. Understanding and adapting to a changing Arctic requires creative new directions for Arctic-related research, education, workforce development, and leveraging of science, engineering, and technology advances from outside the Arctic. Navigating the New Arctic (NNA) embodies an important forward-looking response by the Foundation to these profound challenges.

Agency Overview: The Advanced Research Projects Agency &#8211; Energy (ARPA-E), an organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), is chartered by Congress in the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69), as amended by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358), as further amended by the Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-260) to: &#8220;(A) to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that&#8212; (i) reduce imports of energy from foreign sources; (ii) reduce energy-related emissions, including greenhouse gases; (iii) improve the energy efficiency of all economic sectors; (iv) provide transformative solutions to improve the management, clean-up, and disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; and (v) improve the resilience, reliability, and security of infrastructure to produce, deliver, and store energy; and (B) to ensure that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.&#8221; ARPA-E issues this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) under its authorizing statute codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 16538. The FOA and any awards made under this FOA are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on and the development of transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established &#8220;learning curves&#8221; where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive down the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. By contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly lower than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive &#8211; that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development. The Office of Management and Budget defines &#8220;applied research&#8221; as an &#8220;original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge&#8230;directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective&#8221; and defines &#8220;experimental development&#8221; as &#8220;creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&amp;D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy (http://fossil.energy.gov/), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (http://energy.gov/oe/office-electricity-delivery-and-energy-reliability). Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as &#8220;experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts&#8221;) should contact the DOE&#8217;s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/).

Program Overview: The goal of the HESTIA program is to support the development of technologies that nullify embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (see Section I.B above), while simultaneously transforming buildings into net carbon storage structures. Specifically, projects funded under the HESTIA Program will develop and demonstrate building materials and whole-building designs that are net carbon negative (see Section I.B above) on a life cycle basis by utilizing atmospheric CO2 or CH4 (see Section I.B above) from a wide range of potential feedstocks (e.g., forestry and purpose-grown products, agricultural residues, marine derived, direct carbon utilization) in the production process. HESTIA metrics are: &#8226;storage of more carbon in the chemical structure of the finished product than emitted during manufacture, construction, and use, &#8226;relevant performance testing (e.g., flammability, strength) as required per applicable building code and incumbent specifications, &#8226;market advantage (e.g., improved material performance in at least one area, lower cost, easier installation) over the best-in-class incumbent building element(s) (i.e. structural and/or enclosure) selected for replacement, and &#8226;sufficient retention of carbon storage over service lifetime and minimized end-of-life emissions where possible by designing for reuse, repurposing, and/or recycling. This FOA supports the development of viable technologies to achieve these metrics in a cost-effective manner to meet building construction industry demand for low-cost. Technical categories of interest are identified in Section I.E of the FOA. Performance targets for the technical categories of interest are provided in Section I.F of the FOA. Section I.G of the FOA provides information on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) requirements. To ensure that the technologies developed through this Program are evaluated consistently and transparently, a separate solicitation will be used to develop and perform Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) in conjunction with and to support Applicants of this FOA. The HESTIA Program offers a unique opportunity to address the growing need for market-ready negative emission technologies to implement carbon removal strategies by changing the paradigm for building construction through the use of carbon negativity as a design parameter. Projects will create novel designs that maximize the energy benefits of carbon storage in addition to manufacturing methods and performance of the materials themselves.

Initially, scholarships were only provided for students in math, engineering, and computer science. Later legislation authorized NSF to expand the eligible disciplines at the discretion of the NSF director. This revised solicitation expands the eligibility of degrees to most disciplinary fields in which NSF provides research funding (with some exclusions described elsewhere in this document) as long as there is a national or regional demand for professionals with those degrees to address the long-term workforce needs of the United States. The main goal of the S-STEM program is to enable low-income students with academic ability, talent or potential to pursue successful careers in promising STEM fields. Ultimately, the S-STEM program seeks to increase the number of low-income students who graduate with a S-STEM eligible degree and contribute to the American innovation economy with their STEM knowledge. Recognizing that financial aid alone cannot increase retention and graduation in STEM, the program provides awards to institutions of higher education (IHEs) not only to fund scholarships, but also to adapt, implement, and study evidence-based curricular and co-curricular[1] activities that have been shown to be effective supporting recruitment, retention, transfer (if appropriate), student success, academic/career pathways, and graduation in STEM. Social mobility for low-income students with academic potential is even more crucial than for students that enjoy other economic support structures. Hence, social mobility cannot be guaranteed unless the scholarship funds the pursuit of degrees in areas where rewarding jobs are available after graduation with an undergraduate or graduate degree. The S-STEM program encourages collaborations, including but not limited to partnerships among different types of institutions; collaborations of S-STEM eligible faculty, researchers, and academic administrators focused on investigating the factors that affect low-income student success (e.g., institutional, educational, behavioral and social science researchers); and partnerships among institutions of higher education and business, industry, local community organizations, national labs, or other federal or state government organizations, as appropriate. Scholars must be domestic low-income students, with academic ability, talent or potential and with demonstrated unmet financial need who are enrolled in an associate, baccalaureate, or graduate degree program in an S-STEM eligible discipline. Proposers must provide an analysis that articulates the characteristics and academic needs of the population of students they are trying to serve. NSF is particularly interested in supporting the attainment of degrees in fields identified as critical needs for the Nation. Many of these fields have high demand for training professionals that can operate at the convergence of disciplines and include but are not limited to quantum computing and quantum science, robotics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, computer science, data science and computational science applied to other frontier STEM areas and other STEM or technology fields in urgent need of domestic professionals. It is up to the proposer to make a compelling case that a field is a critical need field in the United States. S-STEM Eligible Degree Programs Associate of Arts, Associate of Science, Associate of Engineering, and Associate of Applied Science Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Engineering and Bachelor of Applied Science Master of Arts, Master of Science and Master of Engineering Doctoral S-STEM Eligible Disciplines Disciplinary fields in which research is funded by NSF, with the following exceptions: Clinical degree programs, including medical degrees, nursing, veterinary medicine, physical therapy, and others not funded by NSF, are ineligible degrees. Business school programs that lead to Bachelor of Arts or Science in Business Administration degrees (BABA/BSBA/BBA) are not eligible for S-STEM funding. Masters and Doctoral degrees in Business Administration are also excluded. Technology fields associated with the S-STEM-eligible disciplines (e.g., biotechnology, chemical technology, engineering technology, information technology).

Urban and community forestry has the potential to meet community needs arising from extreme heat, high energy costs, flooding, clean air, natural disaster relief and green jobs. The next step is to build on this momentum and engage and empower our communities to care for their urban and community forests.       GRANT CATEGORY  Messaging Urban and Community Forestry for All    This Year&#8217;s National Urban and Community Forest Challenge Cost Share Grant Program will focus on the National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council / public&#8217;s National Ten Year Urban and Community Forestry Action Plan (2016-2026) - Goal 7&#8212;Strategy B: Create a nationwide urban forestry public awareness and messaging for Urban and Community Forestry.    Successful messages will be inclusive and resonate with various cultural and sociodemographic groups and geographical areas of the country and its territories to promote an understanding of urban and community forestry and the mission, brand, and goals of the Forest Service Urban and Community Forestry Program. The campaign should encourage stewardship of urban forests by demonstrating the value its natural resource services contribute to a community&#8217;s viability, resiliency, and well-being.      The nationwide messaging campaign must be able to be customized for regional and local audiences. Using various forms of emerging media, it must develop a digital relationship to engage citizens in understanding trees and urban forests as a vital part of a community&#8217;s health and security. The messaging campaign should also address national priorities of environmental and climate justice.",10.675,20.0,"While Private organizations may not apply directly, they may partner with an eligible applicant.",USDA-FS,Forest Service,2022022,4082022.0,2022022,500000.0,100000.0,1000000.0,5.0,"To Apply On-line, Go to: https://ucfgrants2022.urbanandcommunityforests.org Proposals must meet the Urban and Community Forestry Program Authorities as designated by Congress in the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act, (Section 9 PDF, pp. 19-24) State &amp; Private Cooperative Forestry Handbook of Programs and identity with Goal 7 -Strategy B of the National Ten Year Urban and Community Forestry Action Plan (2016-2026).

Growing the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce is a national priority. National forecasts of the impending shortage of science and engineering skills and essential research workforce underscore a need to expand opportunities to participate in STEM research (President&#8217;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, 2012) (Link to 2012 report). NSF has taken steps to expand participation by focusing on research communities that are not well-represented in the federal research system. Through these steps, NSF is working to expand the volume and increasing the diversity, interconnectedness, and effectiveness of the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce. MSIs make considerable contributions to educating and training science leaders for U.S. economic growth and competitiveness. Yet, NSF has received comparatively few grant submissions from, or involving, scholars at MSIs. Targeted outreach activities reveal that MSIs have varying degrees of familiarity with funding opportunities within NSF and particularly within the Social, Behavioral and Economic (SBE) Sciences Directorate. As a result, NSF is limited in its ability to support research and training opportunities in the SBE sciences at these institutions. With its emphasis on broadening participation of MSIs, Build and Broaden 3.0 is designed to address this problem. SBE offers Build and Broaden 3.0 in order to increase proposal submissions, advance research collaborations and networks involving MSI scholars, and support research activities in the SBE sciences at MSIs. The Build and Broaden 3.0 solicitation is designed specifically for impact at MSIs. Proposals that outline research projects in the SBE sciences that increase students&#8217; pursuit of graduate training, enhance PI productivity, or cultivate partnerships with researchers at other institutions are especially encouraged to apply. Proposals are invited from single Principal Investigators based at MSIs and from multiple co-investigators from a group of MSIs. Principal Investigators who are not affiliated with MSIs may submit proposals, butmust collaborate with PIs, co-PIs, or Senior Personnel from MSIsand describe how their project will foster research partnerships or capacity-building with at least one MSI as a primary goal of the proposed work. Proposals may address any of the scientific areas supported by SBE.

As such, when responding to this solicitation, even though proposals must be submitted to the Directorate for Engineering (ENG) Office of Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Activities (ENG/EFMA),once received, the proposals will be managed by a cross-disciplinary team of NSF Program Directors. The overarching vision of this program is to support multi-disciplinary research to sustain economic competitiveness, to promote worker well-being, lifelong and pervasive learning, and quality of life, and to illuminate the emerging social and economic context and drivers of innovations that are shaping the future of jobs and work. For the purposes of this solicitation, work is defined as mental or physical activity to achieve tangible benefit such as income, profit, or community welfare. A proposal for a research grant in this program must focus on advancing fundamental understanding of future work and work outcomes for workers and society. The specific objectives of the Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier program are to (1) facilitate multi-disciplinary or convergent research that employs the joint perspectives, methods, and knowledge of behavioral science, computer science, economics, engineering, learning sciences, research on adult learning and workforce training, and the social sciences; (2) develop deeper understandings of how human needs can be met and values respected in regard to how new technologies, conditions, and work experiences are changing; (3) support deeper understanding of the societal infrastructure that accompanies and leads to new work technologies and new approaches to work and jobs, and that prepares people for the future world of work; (4) encourage the development of a research community dedicated to designing intelligent technologies and work organization and modes inspired by their positive impact on individual workers, the work at hand, the way people learn and adapt to technological change, creative and inclusive workplaces (including remote locations, homes, classrooms, or virtual spaces), and benefits for social, economic, educational, and environmental systems at different scales; (5) promote deeper basic understanding of the interdependent human-technology partnership to advance societal needs by advancing design of intelligent technologies that operate in harmony with human workers, including consideration of how adults learn the new skills needed to interact with these technologies in the workplace, and by enabling broad and diverse workforce participation, including improving accessibility for those challenged by physical or cognitive impairment; and (6) understand, anticipate, and explore ways of mitigating potential risks including inequity arising from future work at the human-technology frontier. Proposals to this program should describe multi-disciplinary or convergent research that addresses technological, human, and societal dimensions of future work. Technological innovations should be integrated with advances in behavioral science, computer science, economic science, engineering, learning sciences, research on adult learning and workforce training, and the social sciences.

Plant scientists and breeders recognize that potentially bigger gains in productivity and sustainability may be realized in such crops by leveraging multi-omics approaches, systems biology, and computational biology to better understand the regulation of critical plant processes at the molecular level. However, understanding molecular function remains a challenge in plants due to several unique features, such as segmental and whole genome duplications, differences in mode of reproduction, and domestication. Advances in &#8216;omics technologies together with computational modeling and data analysis are enabling the gathering of information on critical and complex plant processes such as metabolism, development, and signaling. Although immense amounts of data can be generated by these methodologies, much of the functional information obtained from them is generated by correlation analysis and computational inference, lacking causal and verifiable knowledge. Experimental characterization of gene function continues to be a significant bottleneck, hampering our ability to fully exploit the potential of available &#8216;omics data. This in turn limits direct understanding of how genes regulate organismal function and ultimately the ability to accurately assign and validate gene function in non-model organisms. By elucidating complex regulatory processes at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels, a better understanding of plants as a whole and a more accurate prediction of plant behavior under varying conditions can be achieved. To overcome these obstacles, more efficient, high-throughput methods for interpreting experimental evidence need to be developed for accurate determination of gene function. While experimental approaches are unlikely to scale with advances in &#8216;omics technologies, concentrated development and application of new approaches are required to tackle this critical knowledge gap of genomics space. The overarching goal of this FOA is to address the challenges and opportunities in associating gene(s) to function (i.e., genotype to phenotype) in plant systems of relevance to the BER mission in energy and the environment. Specifically, this FOA seeks applications that employ systems biology and high throughput approaches to elucidate and validate the functional roles of genes, gene families, and associated pathways related to physiological and metabolic processes such as CO2 sequestration and below-ground storage; nutrient and water use efficiency; tolerance and/or resistance to abiotic stresses such as drought and temperature extremes; developmental processes critical to enhanced biomass yield and optimization or extension of growth range; and metabolism of oils and fatty acids for biofuels and bioproducts.",Synopsis 2,No,4242022.0,cathy.ronning@science.doe.gov,cathy.ronning@science.doe.gov,Cathy Ronning &lt;br/&gt;cathy.ronning@science.doe.gov,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Fukushima Daiichi incident, along with progress in the development of advanced materials, provided the impetus to improve nuclear fuel performance and safety, thereby mitigating the effects of a severe accident. To support the research and development of advanced ATF, NE, under 2012 guidance, initiated an industry-oriented program to accelerate improvements to LWR fuel performance and safety. The goal of this ATF development effort is to have one or more LWR advanced fuel concepts in commercial implementation in the late 2020&#8217;s time period. Toward that end several concepts are being pursued that involve either coating on existing LWR clad material or a new non-metallic type of cladding. The silicon carbide ceramic matrix clad concept is an example of the latter. The operational constraint on all ATF concepts is that they fit geometrically into existing LWRs, and, in comparison with standard LWR fuel, should be able to tolerate loss of active cooling in a severe accident for a considerably longer time period, and maintain or improve fuel performance during normal operations. Because of its non-metallic nature, silicon carbide ceramic matrix composite fuel cladding has a potential to tolerate higher accident transient temperatures with lower hydrogen production in the severe accident situation and thereby meet desired ATF safety enhancements. However, silicon carbide ceramic matrix composite fuel cladding has significant manufacturing development hurdles that must also be addressed. The result of the ATF development activities, if successful, will be one or more commercial products that is utilized in existing and future nuclear power plants. While the end user of the new technology will be the nuclear industry, the Government has a major role in facilitating the initial research, development, and deployment (RD&amp;D) to support the effort, because the effort is primarily focused on continued use of clean energy technology with enhanced safety that is in the public&apos;s interest.",Synopsis 2,Yes,4032022.0,bolinem@id.doe.gov,Click to email contact,Marianne Boline 208-526-3743&lt;br/&gt;bolinem@id.doe.gov,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many cutting-edge research questions require international collaboration to achieve important advances. They also require insights from diverse disciplines to address the full complexity of the research, as well as active participation of stakeholders outside of academia to ensure research findings connect to real-world solutions to societal challenges related to climate change and/or clean energy. Climate change and clean energy research teams that incorporate some of these characteristics are increasingly common, but many have not had the opportunity to fully integrate all elements into their research agenda. This PIRE program invites PIs to develop these partnerships to exploit their full potential in the future. The projects will utilize multi-stakeholder and international partnerships that are essential to address these challenges of critical societal importance at a regional or global scale. The research areas may include any combination of the natural and physical sciences, engineering, and the social sciences.Proposals that advance understanding of the human and behavioral aspects of climate change and/or clean energy challenges are encouraged.Educational activities should be integral to the project. Only high caliber research proposals that require international collaborations and show a clear potential for rapid scale-up and growth will be considered. Proposals that could be submitted to regular disciplinary and interdisciplinary programs at NSF will be returned without review. Proposals must clearly and succinctly address the following requirements. Note that reviewers will be asked to comment on how well these points are addressed in the submitted proposals. &#183; What is the societal challenge of global importance to be addressed? &#183; What is the novel scientific challenge of the proposed research? How will the proposed project utilize inter-, multi-, trans-disciplinary approaches and/or convergence approaches to address the science challenge? &#183; What is the proposed use-inspired nature of the research? &#183; Why is the international partnership required, who are the partners, what are their contributions and roles in the project? &#183; What is the role of multi-sector and multi-stakeholder partners included (including but not limited to academia, private sector, public sector, philanthropies, etc.) in the proposed PIRE project? &#183; How will diversity, equity and inclusion be integrated into the research and education effort? &#183; What is your vision and strategy for growth, scaling up and expanding the research beyond the PIRE project period? The PIRE projects are expected to be driven by a bold vision for high-impact use-inspired basic research along with a strategy to leverage the PIRE opportunity to integrate diverse perspectives from different disciplines, international partners, and stakeholder groups into the research. It is expected that this effort will enhance societal benefits and increase potential to scale up and expand the partnerships beyond the PIRE funding period, catalyzing center-level activities in the future. Awards are intended to support a combination of research and readiness-building that fully integrates a diverse set of partners into the research agenda, regularly engages relevant stakeholders and adapts the research to incorporate relevant insights. Education efforts are expected to play an integral role in this effort, and both research and education plans are expected to reflect intentional effort to advance diversity, equity and inclusion in science and engineering. It is envisioned that PIRE funded projects will demonstrate readiness to scale-up and expand their partnerships to compete successfully for support to undertake center-scale activities and to serve as enduring international hubs of research excellence that advance knowledge, empower communities, and generate discovery and innovative technological solutions at a regional or global scale.

To translate advances in synthetic and engineering biology into products and processes that will impact the U.S. bioeconomy, there is a need to accelerate innovation and adopt new biomanufacturing approaches. The integrated Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) capabilities of the DOE BETO funded Agile BioFoundry (ABF) offer a unique resource to the academic community to develop and implement innovative biodesign and biomanufacturing technologies and practices. To help advance the U.S. bioeconomy, these agencies invite proposals from researchers at institutions of higher education and non-profit organizations (eligible PIs). The proposals must leverage the unique DBTL capabilities available at the ABF to translate the latest advances in synthetic biology and engineering biology basic research into testable prototype processes and products that are potentially scalable and manufacturable and can be appropriately validated. Of particular interest are proposals that both leverage the DBTL capabilities of the ABF to translate basic science into bioeconomy-relevant innovation and also lead to the development of generalizable rules or theories of biological systems that enhance our understanding of basic science. In order to facilitate the utilization of the integrated DBTL capabilities available at the ABF and ensure the readiness of basic research projects for their translation to ABF platforms, NSF would support efforts of eligible PIs and their students, postdoctoral fellows, and other lab personnel on projects that can leverage the unique capabilities of the ABF. NSF support would be for all activity at the institution of higher education or non-profit organization that occurs in parallel to, or prior to, the work at ABF that readies the project for translation to practice. In order to increase collaboration across sectors and workforce development, NSF, through this program, can also support short term faculty fellows, post-doctoral fellows, graduate students or undergraduate student interns that are hosted by national laboratories or ABF. DOE BETO will cover the costs for implementation of approved projects at ABF. Partnering with industry is encouraged for technologies both to facilitate eventual scale up and regulatory approval.

Status reports would be submitted quarterly, with a final report at the end of the performance period. Objective 1: Develop, implement, and evaluate methods track fluctuations in the populations of native and invasive aquatic vegetation in reservoirs by conducting surveys to measure the extent and volume of vegetation and to determine the estimated area available for spread of aquatic vegetation. The researcher will identify and implement methods for the survey of standing vegetation and sampling of hydrilla tuber banks. Need for survey and sampling at the lakes will be determined annually. It is anticipated that the base year would include whole lake vegetation point surveys at Falls Lake, Jordan Lake, and Philpott Lake, and tuber bank sampling at Falls Lake, Kerr Lake, and Philpott Lake. It is anticipated that Option Year 1 would include whole lake vegetation point surveys and tuber bank sampling Falls Lake, Kerr Lake, and Philpott Lake. Additional option year activities will be determined based on-site conditions and research findings. Objective 2: Develop, implement, and evaluate methods for control and/or eradication of invasive aquatic vegetation by evaluating the effects of treatments on native and invasive aquatic vegetation and the hydrilla tuber bank. The researcher will identify, recommend, and evaluate chemical, biological, and/or mechanical methods for aquatic vegetation control and/or eradication. Methods currently utilized are stocking of triploid grass carp and selective herbicide treatments. Methods recommended may be implemented by the government, government lessees, permit holders, and/or the researcher. The base year is anticipated to include the evaluation of the effectiveness of the ongoing government stocking of triploid grass carp in Kerr Lake and the effectiveness researcher applied herbicide treatments on infestations at Philpott Lake (up to 33 acres of hydrilla and 2 acres of Brazilian elodea) and Falls Lake (up to 7 acres of hydrilla). Option year activities will be determined based on-site conditions and research findings. Objective 3: Develop, implement, and evaluate methods to promote spread of beneficial native aquatic vegetation by identifying planting sites, evaluating sediment and water quality, identifying appropriate species for planting, identifying suitable plant sources, preparing planting plans, installing plants, and assessing status of plantings over time. The base year would include assessment and maintenance of existing native vegetation planting sites at Falls Lake, Kerr Lake, Philpott Lake, and Scott Lake; installation of native vegetation planting sites at Jordan Lake; and water quality monitoring at Scott Lake.

Roosevelt stated, &#8220;A nation that destroys its soils destroys itself.&quot; This statement remains true to this day. Soils form over hundreds of years, and yet can be destroyed in a single event. They are an often-overlooked natural asset despite being the foundation of terrestrial ecosystems that support food production, economic prosperity, and many other services that are essential for humanity. Soils are complex ecosystems composed of organic matter, minerals, water, air, and billions of organisms. Such ecosystems interact with the flora and fauna they support to mediate myriad biological, chemical, and physical processes essential for plant growth, food and fiber production, and contaminant removal. Soils are also the foundation material for all structures not supported on rock, and, by orders of magnitude, are the most widely-used construction material in the world. Soils are the source of most of the antibiotics used to fight human diseases, control the movement of water and chemical substances between the Earth and atmosphere, and act as source and storage media for gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and methane. &#8239;As a result of their essential importance, soils are also part of our cultural heritage. Furthermore, soils serve as major storage media for carbon, a role that is potentially exploitable in climate change mitigation and adaption strategies. Thus, as the Earth&#8217;s population grows, we need a better understanding of soil ecosystems that will continue to play a critical role in supporting societies around the world. The National Science Foundation (NSF) Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Geosciences (GEO), the Divisions of Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS) and &#8239;Environmental Biology (DEB), in the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO), the Division of Computer and Network Systems (CNS) in the Directorate Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), the Division of Chemistry (CHE) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (BCS) in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE), in collaboration with the US Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA NIFA) encourage convergent research that transforms existing capabilities in understanding dynamic soil processes, including soil formation, through advances in sensor systems and modeling.&#8239; The Signals in the Soil (SitS) program fosters collaboration among the two&#8239;partner agencies and the researchers they support by combining resources and funding for the most innovative and high-impact projects that address their respective missions. To make transformative advances in our understanding of soils, multiple disciplines must converge to produce environmentally-benign novel sensing systems with multiple modalities that can adapt to different environments and collect and transmit data for a wide range of biological, chemical, and physical parameters. Effective integration of sensor data will be key for achieving a better understanding of signaling interactions among plants, animals, microbes, the soil matrix, and aqueous and gaseous components. New sensor networks have the potential to inform models in novel ways, to radically change how data is obtained from various natural and managed (both urban and rural) ecosystems, and to better inform the communities that directly rely on soils for sustenance and livelihood.",Synopsis 1,No,5142022.0,grantsgovsupport@nsf.gov,"If you have any problems linking to this funding announcement, please contact the email address above.",NSF grants.gov support&lt;br/&gt;grantsgovsupport@nsf.gov,http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf22550,NSF Publication 22-550,,,,,,,,,,

214,337327,Small Community Air Service Development Program,DOT-OST-2022-0003,D,G,T,,20.93,25.0,"1. Eligible ApplicantsThe Department determines application eligibility as part of the Eligibility Review stage.  Applicants and applications deemed ineligible at this stage will be disqualified.  The Department will apply the criteria under Section C.1 as part of the Eligibility Review stage.Only public entities may apply for and serve as the legal sponsor of a grant under the Small Community Program.  Private organizations cannot be the lead applicant. A community may file only one application for a grant, either individually or as part of a consortium.Consortium Applications:  Both individual communities and consortia of communities are eligible for SCASDP funds.  An application from a consortium of communities must be one that seeks to facilitate the efforts of the communities working together toward one joint grant project, with one joint objective, including the establishment of one entity to ensure that the joint objective is accomplished.Communities Without Existing Air Service:  Communities that do not currently have commercial air service are eligible for SCASDP funds.  Eligible Projects:  The Department is authorized to award grants under 49 U.S.C. &#167; 41743(d) to communities that seek to provide assistance to:&#8226; A U.S. air carrier  to subsidize service to and from an underserved airport for a period not to exceed 3 years;&#8226; An underserved airport to obtain service to and from the underserved airport; and/or&#8226; An underserved airport to implement such other measures as the Secretary, in consultation with such airport, considers appropriate to improve air service both in terms of the cost of such service to consumers and the availability of such service, including improving air service through marketing and promotion of air service and enhanced utilization of airport facilities.Eligibility Limitations: Hub Size:  In order to satisfy the hub size requirement set forth in 49 U.S.C. &#167; 41743(c)(1)(A), the airport serving the community or consortium may not be larger than a small hub airport, as determined using the FAA&#8217;s most recently published classification effective on the Department&#8217;s set application deadline (due date). Same Project Limitation:  Under 49 U.S.C. &#167; 41743(c)(4)(B), a community or consortium may not receive a new grant to support the same project more than once in a ten-year period.   In assessing whether a previous recipient&#8217;s current application represents a new project, the Department will compare the goals and objectives of the previous grant, including the key components of the means by which those goals and objectives were to be achieved, to the current application.  For example, if a community received an earlier grant to support a revenue guarantee for service to a particular destination or direction, a new application by that community for another revenue guarantee for service to the same destination or in the same direction would be subject to the ten-year restriction, even if the revenue guarantee were structured differently or the type of carrier were different.  However, a new application by such a previous recipient for service to a new destination or direction using a revenue guarantee, or for general marketing and promotion (including advertising and public relations) of the airport and the various services it offers, would be eligible.   The Department recognizes that not all revenue guarantees, marketing agreements, studies, or other activities are of the same nature, and that if a subsequent application incorporates different goals or significantly different components, it may be sufficiently different to constitute a new project under 49 U.S.C. &#167; 41743(c).In FAA 2018, Congress authorized limited waivers of the Ten-Year Same Project Limitation.  Under Section 41743(c)(4)(C), the Secretary may waive the limitation, and thus make additional grants to a community or consortium of communities to participate in support of the same project w",DOT-DOT X-50,69A345 Office of the Under Secretary for Policy,1122022,3152022.0,1122022,17000000.0,0.0,17000000.0,25.0,"A. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Small Community Program was established by the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (Pub. L. No. 106-181), reauthorized by the Vision 100-Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act (Pub. L. No. 108-176), and subsequently reauthorized by the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (Pub. L. No. 112-95) as amended, the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017 (Pub. L. No. 115-63), and the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (Pub. L. No. 115-254) (FAA 2018). The program is codified at 49 U.S.C. &#167; 41743. The program is designed to provide financial assistance to small communities to help them enhance their air service. The Department provides this assistance in the form of grants that are disbursed on a reimbursable basis.The Small Community Program is authorized to receive appropriations under 49 U.S.C. &#167; 41743(e)(2). Appropriations are provided for this program for award selection in FY 2021 pursuant to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (Pub. L.

However, our current system also allows defendants who have a high probability of flight or of being re-arrested to be released from custody, thus compromising public safety and confidence of the criminal justice system.The National Institute of Corrections recognizes the necessity for state and local criminal justice systems to develop pretrial justice systems and agencies with established structures based on the law and evidence-based practices that help practitioners make consistent pretrial release and detention decisions. The pretrial release or detention decision is critical and is known to affect future criminal justice decisions and outcomes for a defendant.

This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) solicits applications for projects funded under the Local and Regional Project Assistance Program, known as the RAISE Grants program. The Notice published on January 28, 2022 amends and replaces in its entirety the Notice published on January 14, 2022.If the FY 2022 Appropriations Act provides additional funding for the RAISE grants program and/or significantly different requirements for National Infrastructure Investment funds, the Department will amend this Notice with guidance on additional requirements.As with previous rounds, funds for the FY 2022 RAISE Transportation program are to be awarded on a competitive basis for projects that will have a significant local or regional impact. The BIL mandates that DOT will award at least five percent of available funds, ($75 million of the $1.5 billion) for the planning, preparation or design of eligible projects.The BIL specifies that not more than 50 percent of funds can be spent on projects located in a rural area with a population equal to or less than 200,000 and not more than 50 percent of funds can be spent on projects located in an urbanized area with a population of more than 200,000. Pursuant to the BIL, no more than 15 percent of the funds made available for RAISE Transportation Discretionary Grants (or $225 million) may be awarded to projects in a single State. Further, pursuant to the BIL, DOT must take measures to ensure an equitable geographic distribution of grant funds, an appropriate balance in addressing the needs of urban and rural areas, and investment in a variety of transportation modes. The BIL, requires that FY 2022 RAISE funds are only available for obligation through September 30, 2026. All RAISE funds must be expended by September 30, 2031. As part of the review and selection process described in the Notice of Funding Opportunity, DOT will consider whether a project is ready to proceed with an obligation of grant funds from DOT within the statutory time provided. Under the BIL, no waiver is possible for these deadlines. The BIL allows for up to 20 percent of available funds (or $300 million) to be used by the Department to pay the subsidy and administrative costs for a project receiving credit assistance under the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998 (&#8220;TIFIA&#8221;) program, if it would further the purposes of the RAISE Transportation Discretionary Grant program. Recipients of prior RAISE, BUILD or TIGER Discretionary Grants may apply for funding to support additional phases of a project awarded funds in earlier rounds of this program. However, to be competitive, the applicant should demonstrate the extent to which the previously funded project phase has been able to meet estimated project schedules and budget, as well as the ability to realize the benefits expected for the project. DOT expects that each RAISE Transportation Discretionary Grant will be administered by one of the relevant modal administrations, pursuant to a grant agreement between the RAISE Transportation Discretionary Grant recipient and the relevant modal administration.The BIL specifies that RAISE Transportation Discretionary Grants may not be less than $5 million and not greater than $25 million, except that for projects located in rural areas the minimum RAISE Transportation Discretionary Grant size is $1 million.",Synopsis 2,Yes,1312023.0,andrea.jacobson@dot.gov,Program Manager,Andrea Jacobson &lt;br/&gt;Program Manager,www.transportation.gov/RAISEgrants,RAISE Transportation Discretionary Grant Program,"Detailed Instructions on &quot;How to Apply&quot; for RAISE Transportation Discretionary Grants will be posted on the RAISE Website (www.transportation.gov/RAISEgrants).

Topics A, C, and D require the use of high fidelity, multi-qubit devices, such as gate-defined SiGe or MOS quantum dots or high fidelity multi-qubit superconducting qubit devices to achieve their objectives. Such qubits can be available in-house by the proposing team, via collaborations funded as part of this BAA and/or sourced from a suitable proven qubit foundry. High fidelity refers to the demonstrated ability to implement state-of-the-art low error universal quantum gates and low error readout. Using such qubits, these topics explore novel control techniques (C), noise (D), and information distribution schemes (A).In contrast, topic B focuses on new spin and superconducting qubits which have a demonstrated superior performance metric when compared to standard leading gate-based qubits. Superior may be defined in relation to a particular performance metric, without sacrificing other important performance metrics (e.g., T1, T2, valley splitting, environmental requirements, etc.).

The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program was originally established in 1982 by the Small Business Innovation Development Act (P.L. 97-219), codified at 15 U.S.C. &#167; 638. It was then expanded and extended by the Small Business Research and Development Enhancement Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-564), and received subsequent reauthorization and extensions, the most recent of which extends the SBIR program through 2022. (P.L. 114-328). Each Federal agency with an extramural budget for Research/Research and Development (R/R&amp;D) in excess of $100,000,000 must participate in the SBIR program and spend (obligate) a minimum percentage of their extramural R/R&amp;D budgets (obligations) of not less than 3.2% of such budget in fiscal year 2017 and for the percentage required by statute for each fiscal year after for awards to small business concerns (SBCs) for R/R&amp;D under the SBIR program. The objectives of the SBIR program are to: stimulate technological innovation in the private sector; strengthen the role of small business in meeting Federal R&amp;D needs; foster and encourage participation by businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged persons and women-owned SBCs in technological innovation; and increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from federal R&amp;D funding. Fostering diversity by encouraging the participation of individuals from nationally underrepresented groups in the scientific research workforce is longstanding interest of Congress, and a key component of NOAA&#8217;s commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (e.g., Public Law 114-329, American Innovation and Competitiveness Act of 2017, and https://tpo-dev.oar.woc.noaa.gov/abouttpo/dei-statement/).

As an NSF broadening participation emphasis program, AISL recognizes that an intentional and explicit strategy that advances equity is key to effectively building research and practice capacity in the informal STEM learning field. To that end, the National Science Foundation seeks proposals to create an AISL Equity Resource Center (AERC) to advance equity within the informal STEM learning field through community building; supporting and extending infrastructures; technical assistance; and communications. For the purposes of this solicitation, the program does not define or bound the concept of equity. Instead, this call allows the proposer to both define equity in relation to the needs of informal STEM learning field and design and deploy creative approaches that promote equity across the informal STEM learning field. Overall, the AISL program seeks an AERC that will serve public and professional communities in the informal STEM learning field through the following functions: Cultivate a multi-sector, diverse community dedicated to promoting equity in informal STEM learning experiences and environments. Raise the visibility and impact of equity-focused research and practice in the informal STEM learning field and its contributions to the overall STEM endeavor. Support AISL PIs, prospective PIs, and partners in enacting their commitments to equity with respect to research and practice. Promote equitable practices that support the AISL program. Through these functions, the AISL program seeks to make clear that advancing equity is imperative to advancing informal STEM learning experiences and environments and their value to individuals, communities, and the nation. The primary audiences for AERC are individuals and organizations that want to grow their ability to design and conduct equity-focused, evidence-based innovations in informal STEM research, programming, or both. The stakeholders served by the center should include, but are not limited to, AISL PIs and partners; prospective AISL PIs and partners; and additional equity-focused, evidence-based research and practice innovators in informal STEM. AERC should envision, design, and develop creative strategies for actualizing equity in the informal STEM learning field. The AERC approaches to leadership, activities, and evaluation should similarly enact commitments to equity. AISL has had a resource center since 2007.

The long pond is located on the former Germania golf course which is now part of the Refuge. The long pond is a former irrigation pond located near the Tittabawassee River and in it&apos;s current condition has steep vertical walls and provides little to no habitat value and poses a safety concern for visitors to the Refuge. The Service seeks to award this cooperative agreement to an entity that can survey they existing pond, develop a restoration design in collaboration with the Service which will connect the long pond to the Tittabawassee River and soften the existing vertical banks of the long pond. Preliminary estimates show that this may require relocating up to 20,000 cubic yards of earth. This site is located within the floodplain of the Tittabawasee River and the design will require direction and oversight from the Service to ensure that the design complies with all State and Federal wetland/floodplain/clean water act permits. The Service has already held pre-appplication meetings with local, State, and Federal regulators to ensure this project is permitable and complient with existing laws. The awardee will provide a complete set of design plans that will be used by the Service to apply for local, State, and Federal permits. Furthermore, this project will involve removal of several miles of asphalt golf cart paths that run throughout the entire former golf course. Once all permits have been issued the awardee will provide construction management to complete the project. Construction management services will include: Development of a federal procurement compliant bid package and solicitation of bids from sub-contractors to complete the work of the long pond and removal of cart paths. Provide construction management, oversight, and on-site inspections of all aspects of construction to ensure all aspects of the project are built to design specifications. Ensure all contractors wash and clean equipment prior to entering Refuge (as outlined in the design plans) to prevent invasive species spread. Ensure all fuel stored on the Refuge by sub-contractors is compliant with the Service policy for fuel storage and containment. Ensure any damage to existing Refuge infrastructure (roads, trails, signs, gates, observation platforms) are repaired to pre-construction condition (this may include but not limited to road grading and dike repair upon completion of the project).

A diverse, skilled, capable, and productive workforce is required to effectively leverage and utilize current, emerging, and future CI capabilities &#8211; spanning researchers who use CI, developers of new CI capabilities, and professionals that deploy and operate NSF-supported CI. Developing and sustaining such a dynamic CI workforce presents challenges that are similar across science and engineering research and education fields, such as implementing effective institutional and on-the-job training and refreshing skills to keep up with evolving software, technologies, platforms, and application requirements [1]. The CI workforce also faces somewhat unique challenges due to lack of clear career pathways and disparity in position descriptions. In this broader context, NSF envisions fostering and nurturing diverse communities of CI Professionals (CIP)across all areas of science and engineering research and education [2] by establishing a network of connected and coordinated hubs that recognize and connect CI Professionals, support communications, training, sharing of best practices, and mobility across projects and organizations. To establish this network for all stakeholders of the CI workforce, NSF will support a set of Research Coordination Networks (RCN) to advance CI Professionals communities through transformative and/or new approaches for fostering, nurturing, expanding, and sustaining such communities. The RCN:CIP projects are intended to: foster exchange and community development among CI Professionals; share experience on sustaining and retaining CI Professionals; raise the awareness and importance of CI Professionals in academia, and convey the information to academic leaders on their career development; communicate opportunities for, and importance of, CI Professionals&#8217; collaboration with research and engineering groups; advance best practices for recruiting and developing CI expertise at all levels; explore mutually beneficial partnerships across the different stakeholders in academia, government, non-profits, and industry; and explore the establishment and sustainability of a network of hubs over the longer term, including governance and coordination among these hubs. The RCN:CIP will engage CI Professionals from across the NSF research and education community and will also include representatives from university leadership (e.g., Vice Presidents for Research) and industry. The RCN must maintain a website for dissemination of RCN information, including opportunities for participation. The RCN may be regional, focused on specific research disciplines, or a combination. A key goal, and metric of success, of the RCN investments will be broadening participation. Broad inclusion of minorities and underrepresented communities will be particularly important. RCNs focused on these communities, and/or well-suited opportunities for such institutions to open career paths for such individuals, are encouraged. Geographic diversity is an important consideration and proposals led by institutions in EPSCoR jurisdictions are encouraged. In addition, participation by key organizations and societies (such as ACM &#8211; Association for Computing Machinery, CASC - Coalition for Academic Scientific Computation, and CRA &#8211; Computing Research Association) will be important and is also encouraged. NSF expects the RCN:CIP awardees to coordinate their efforts and activities, for instance through joint workshops and knowledge sharing, towards the goal of defining and establishing an interconnected network of hubs with a common set of high-level objectives and overall outcomes. RCN:CIP will be expected to implement a range of measures to demonstrate progress, efficacy, and improvements.

Separately submitted collaborative proposals are not allowed.    Principal Investigators are limited to one active BRITE award at a time.

The goal of this solicitation is to enable and create opportunities to advance scientific discoveries and new research using a variety of approaches that harness the national talent ecosystem of experienced faculty. Recognizing that a successful faculty research career is neither linear nor continuous, this BRITE solicitation seeksproposals that enable experienced researchers and scholars (tenured or equivalent) to forge new directions or to enter new fields by capitalizing or branching out of their established knowledge domains. All BRITE proposals are expected to address fundamental research that creates new knowledge in one or more CMMI program areas. BRITE proposals must identify key research outcomes and describe the research plans for the period of funding sought. Although collaborative proposals are not permitted and will be returned without review, the PI can include a collaborator in a limited role as senior personnel. The solicitation includes four funding tracks: Synergy, Pivot, Relaunch, and Fellow in support of experienced scientists and engineers (tenured or equivalent). The BRITE Synergy Track is intended to support synthesis research borne out of a disaggregated and accumulated body of prior research outcomes that remain unstudied and unprobed to forge or conceptualize a novel direction, methodology, paradigm, or outcome that is more than the sum of the parts. The BRITE Pivot Track is intended to enable researchers to quickly adapt to the fast-moving pace of research and create new knowledge and research products in their field by infusing new concepts from a different discipline or sub-field. The BRITE Relaunch Track is intended to support tenured or equivalent faculty, who have had a pause in research activity, to relaunch back into active research, and to diversify the experiences of the nation&#8217;s STEM researchers. The BRITE Fellow Track is intended to support established tenured or equivalent researchers who have demonstrated impact beyond scientific output to request extended time and freedom to use their intellectual creativity to explore divergent, bold, and ambitious research ideas where the expected scientific outcomes are highly uncertain and, therefore, high-risk. PIs interested in submitting to the Synergy, Pivot, or Fellow track are strongly encouraged to assess the suitability of their proposal topic prior to submission. All funded projects will form an NSF BRITE cohort and investigators will participate in NSF-organized convenings in the form of an annual review. The expected funding ranges for BRITE Research Grants are: $100,000-$200,000 per year The award duration is 2 years for the BRITE Synergy track awards, 3 years for the BRITE Pivot and Relaunch tracks, and 5 years for the Fellow track awards. Variations from the typical durations will be considered with a clearly stated justification. BRITE proposals responding to this solicitation must include additional sections within the 15-page Project Description entitled: Past Contributions, Research Approach and Research Plan, Track Relevance, Outcomes, and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Plan. Please see &#8220;Full Proposal Preparation Instructions&#8221; for additional details. Investigators who do not align with one of the tracks are not eligible for this solicitation.

298,337653,Molecular Tools for Management of Threatened and Endangered Species,W81EWF-22-SOI-0009,D,CA,ST,,12.63,25.0,This opportunity is restricted to non-federal partners of the Great River and Great Lakes &#8211; Northern Forest Cooperative Ecosystems Studies Unit (CESU).,DOD-COE,Dept. of the Army  --  Corps of Engineers,1272022,3182022.0,1282022,64300.0,0.0,64300.0,1.0,"Background: The government seeks research and technical support for the development and demonstration of molecular tools to assess at-risk species occurrence, genomics, and disease risk on military installations from which samples were collected (Fort McCoy, WI, and Camp Grayling, MI). Exact analyses conducted and the need for additional sample collection will be decided based upon input from installation, ERDC-CERL, and CESU partners. It is anticipated that results from these analyses will be relevant for management throughout the focal species ranges. Details of primary tasks are as follows: Task 1: DNA metabarcoding to assess freshwater aquatic communities Fort McCoy, WI comprises 4,400 acres of wetlands (NRCT, 2015) that harbor diverse communities, including a number of at-risk species such as wood turtle, Glyptemys insculpta, Blanding&#8217;s turtle, Emydoidea blandingii, and four amphibian species considered to be either state endangered (i.e., Blanchard&#8217;s cricket frog, Acris blanchardi) or species of special concern (i.e., the four-toed salamander, Hemidactylium scutatum; the pickerel frog, Lithobates palustris; and the northern leopard frog, Lithobates pipiens). In addition, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources currently regulates 99 aquatic invasive species (64 animals and 35 plants) that pose a risk to Fort McCoy&#8217;s freshwater ecosystems. Understanding where these at-risk and invasive species occur across the installation is a first step in determining effective management strategies. Ponds, ephemeral pools, and streams throughout Fort McCoy will be sampled at three time periods (spring, summer, and fall) during 2022. Specific sampling locations and timing will be determined in consultation with CERL and Fort McCoy Natural Resources Branch staff, based on the natural history of focal species, historical records, and availability of suitable habitat. Sampling estimates include 10 &#8211; 30 locations per sampling period with three replicate water samples collected in 1-liter bottles at each location and stored on ice. Sampling effort will include a 1-liter bottle of molecular-grade water at each site to serve as a control. Water samples will be filtered using a vacuum pump through 0.80 &#956;m cellulose nitrate filter. Filters will be stored in vials of cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) buffer until DNA extraction. DNA will be extracted from sample filters using a modified phenol&#8211;chloroform&#8211;isoamyl alcohol extraction (Renshaw et al., 2015)&#8212; a commonly used method to isolate DNA from substrates containing high levels of PCR inhibitors (e.g., humic substances), which can inhibit downstream applications (Alaeddini, 2012; Turner et al., 2014; Eichmiller et al., 2015). Extracted DNA will be quantified via Qubit fluorometry before generating community metabarcode data via a multi-primer/locus approach (e.g., Evans et al., 2015; Corse et al., 2019). Vertebrate, plant and invertebrate primer sets will be used to generate sequence reads for each eDNA sample collected. Task 2: DNA analyses of bacterial pathogens of ticks to assess disease risk. Ticks are renowned as vectors of disease-causing agents to humans and responsible for nearly 95% of vector-borne diseases in the United States (Eisen et al. 2017). In particular, Lyme disease, caused by the spirochete pathogen, Borrelia burgdorferi s.s., can result in devastating human health consequences. Soldiers involved in training exercises, as well as installation natural resources personnel, can be particularly at risk due to their increased contact with vectors encountered on military ranges (Garcia et al. 2017). Tick species will be sampled on Fort McCoy, WI, via cloth dragging and CO2 trap cloths. Sample sites will be determined based on habitat suitability for tick species and input from CERL and Fort McCoy personnel. At each site, five standard 150-m transects will be established in suitable tick habitat (e.g., leaf litter or grass present in deciduous/mixed forest or ecotonal edge between forest and grassland with evidence of animal activity). These transects will be revisited seasonally (spring, summer, fall) with specific timing dependent on weather and access. A subsample of 50 ticks will be included in pathogen analyses. Pathogen diagnostics will be performed via DNA extraction and amplification using standard RT-PCR methods in a BSL-2/ACL-3 lab. Ixodes scapularis samples will be tested using a CDC screening algorithm for Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia microti, Borrelia burgdorferi s.s., Borrelia miyamotoi, and Ehrlichia muris euclairensis. Task 3: DNA metabarcoding to identify plant-pollinator interactions. Pollinator biomonitoring is critical to both assess the status and trend of at-risk pollinators and evaluate the impacts of biodiversity loss on ecosystem services. Fort McCoy, WI, houses two federally endangered pollinators, the Karner Blue butterfly (Lycaedis melissa samuelis) and the Rusty Patched Bumblebee (Bombus afinis). Fort McCoy is also home to several other pollinator species of conservation concern including the Ottoe Skipper (Hesperia ottoe; state endangered), Regal Fritillary (Speyeria idalia; state endangered), Frosted Elfin butterfly (Callophrys irus; state threatened), Dusted Skipper (Atrytonopsis hianna; special concern) and Leonard&#8217;s Skipper (Hesperia leonardus; special concern). Rapid, efficient, and accurate assessment of pollinator communities is a conservation imperative to inform adaptive management strategies and stanch the loss of this critical component of biodiversity. For this task, traditional pollinator survey methods will be compared to eDNA metabarcoding of flowers to assess effectiveness of eDNA metabarcoding for surveying for at-risk pollinator species and identifying plant-pollinator interactions. Initial focus will be on two pollinator species that are petitioned for federal listing under the Endangered Species Act, the Frosted Elfin and the Regal Fritillary. Traditional surveys will be conducted for both species at Fort McCoy, WI. Survey plots will be determined in collaboration with CERL and Fort McCoy personnel and based on presence of host plants, previous survey efforts, and access. Plot size will vary based on abundance and distribution of host plants. Within plots, surveys will be conducted both via random walk, focusing on presence of host plants, and via fixed 110 x 10 m transects. Surveys will be conducted throughout the active flight period (approximately April&#8211;June) with each plot and transect surveyed at least three times. Each transect walkthrough will occur at a steady pace, start/stop times recorded, and host plant and pollinator species observations tallied. Weather conditions and other environmental data at each patch will be measured and documented prior to counts. Counts will only be conducted if weather is within the range of optimal conditions as specified by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (2019). If no (or few) butterflies are detected during walkthrough, eggs, larvae, and evidence of larval activity on host plants (e.g., feeding damage) will be documented. To assess effectiveness of eDNA metabarcoding for assessing pollinators, target flowers will be randomly chosen within survey areas (above). Target flowers will be identified to species, collected, and preserved in ATL buffer. Trace pollinator eDNA left on the flowers will be extracted using a modified Qiagen DNeasy protocol. Extracted eDNA from flowers will then be subjected to metabarcoding. Once PCR and library preparation have been completed, samples will be submitted to the UIUC Keck Core Sequencing Facility for sequencing on Illumina Platforms. Illumina data will be converted from raw sequences to taxonomic assignments using a custom pipeline for reproducible analysis of metabarcoding data: metaBEAT v0.97.78. Using these data, species will be catalogued via conventional observations as well as eDNA metabarcoding. Task 4: Genomic analyses for at-risk bats (Myotis spp.). Several species of bat across the US have experienced drastic declines since 2006, primarily as a result of disease (white-nose syndrome, WNS), with some species reduced by over of 90% of their pre-WNS numbers. Where populations persist, survivors may provide clues to disease resistance, with recent research finding genetic differences between bats killed by white-nose-syndrome and those that survived (Gignoux-Wolfsohn et al. 2021). At-risk bats (Myotis sp.) will be sampled at Camp Grayling, MI, and tissue samples collected via wing biopsy punch for genomic analysis. Data for at-risk bats are particularly lacking for the northern Midwest region. These data will help fill that gap and enable comparison to studies from other regions for range-wide assessment. Work accomplished under this task will include sample collection, laboratory analyses, and summarization. Data will be used to populate reports to military installations regarding the statuses of at-risk species on their properties.",Synopsis 2,No,12302022.0,stacy.d.thurman@usace.army.mil,Stacy Thurman,Stacy Thurman &lt;br/&gt;Grantor,,,,,,,,,,,,

These headlines are only an indication of the problem as many of these case are settled out of court.Any staff misconduct undermines the credibility and authority of agencies and diminishes both public and legislative support. Staff misconduct can be particularly devastating when it involves allegations of sexual misconduct. Sexual misconduct may include sexual harassment, coercion, and sexual assault, incurring both civil and criminal liability for the agency and the perpetrator. Due to the imbalance of power between staff and individuals on supervision, agencies must ensure that their staff know and understand the ramifications of their actions.The role of community supervision staff is complex and may include elements of both law enforcement and counseling. This dual role can sometimes cause confusion for the staff and the individuals they supervise. Although staff are trained in the issues related to misconduct, supervisors must be able to recognize and address inappropriate and problematic behavior and provide proper support to their staff.An agency&#8217;s leadership must use their influence to demonstrate that sexual misconduct and other inappropriate relationships will not be tolerated. Having strong, clear policies and training on those policies is a good start, but there are additional strategies that can mitigate the effects of this unwanted staff behavior. The National Institute of Corrections (NIC) is seeking to create a whole array of products to assist agencies in preventing and addressing this important issue.",Synopsis 2,No,4282022.0,ccoblentz@bop.gov,Application or Form information,Cameron D Coblentz &lt;br/&gt;Grantor &lt;br/&gt;Phone 202-514-0053,https://nicic.gov/news-media/media-releases/cooperative-agreement-preventing-and-responding-staff-sexual-misconduct,NIC Website,,To create a number of resources to provide agencies assistance in the prevention and response to staff sexual misconduct.,,,,,,,,

Probation officers report to Common Pleas Judges; there are a total of 16 judges in the General Division. The department is organized into several probation units that supervise persons on probation with varying levels of risk and need based on their offense.

The local judiciary is requesting an assessment of current probation agency practices and programming to identify areas that could be improved to align with evidence-based practices that are supportive of promoting and sustaining behavior change for persons under probation supervision. Further, the judiciary requests that the assessment identify best practices that will assist agency leadership and staff in gaining a better understanding of how to implement practices and programming that are supported by research, identify and track key performance measures, and obtain other data that has not previously been collected by the probation department to measure success.

Paroling authorities are always under considerable pressure and subject to substantial public and government scrutiny. This scrutiny is even more acute given the increase in crimes across the United States this past year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#8217;s National Center for Health Statistics reports that homicide rose 30% between 2019 and 2020. In response to increased public interest in the parole decision making process, the National Institute of Corrections (NIC) developed, in collaboration with the Legal Decision-Making Lab of Carleton University, a tool designated as the Structured Decision Making Framework (SDMF) to improve decision making for paroling authorities responsible for releasing individuals into the community from prisons. This tool is a road map or guideline to help parole board members reach consistent, transparent, and defensible release decisions. The structured approach lays out the deliberation process for making parole decisions, considering information about an incarcerated individual that has been demonstrated to be closely linked to positive post-release performance. The SDMF tool&#8217;s use has been supported through research in Canada and in the United States by NIC. The research has demonstrated that using the SDMF increases both accuracy and accountability. Given the high stakes involved in parole decision making, even minimal improvements in the predictive accuracy can result in fewer victims and safer communities. The SDMF is a standardized and structured approach for the parole decision making process that has been validated. It is a due diligence model grounded in evidence-based practice. SDMF is designed for parole releasing authorities, its members, and related criminal justice stakeholders. The strength of the SDMF is its standardization of decision making criteria. The SDMF uses the following &#8220;domains&#8221; (criteria) for releasing decisions: criminal history/parole history; ability to control behavior; responsivity; institutional behavior; offender change; and release plans. The SDMF also considers other factors, such as victim and community input, that are relevant to an individual&#8217;s case or required by law. NIC has developed a specialized SDMF training and implementation program available to all paroling authorities in the United States. It is a part of NIC&#8217;s strategy to directly assist state and local jurisdictions to improve operations and services.",Synopsis 2,No,4282022.0,ccoblentz@bop.gov,Application or Form information,Cameron D Coblentz &lt;br/&gt;Grantor &lt;br/&gt;Phone 202-514-0053,https://nicic.gov/news-media/media-releases/cooperative-agreement-structured-decision-making-framework-sdmf,NIC Website,,"This work involves facilitating the implementation of the tool to paroling authorities and the revision of the technical assistance process to include blended sessions, both virtual and face-to-face.",,,,,,,,

Eligibility Requirements  Applicants for the Alaska Native-Serving and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions Education Competitive Grants Program (ANNH) must meet all the requirements discussed in this RFA. Failure to meet the eligibility criteria by the application deadline may result in exclusion from consideration or, preclude NIFA from making an award. For those new to Federal financial assistance, NIFA&#8217;s Grants Overview provides highly recommended information about grants and other resources to help understand the Federal awards process.  For the purpose of the ANNH Grants Program, an eligible institution means an individual public or private, nonprofit Alaska Native-Serving and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions of higher education that meet the definitions of Alaska-Serving Institutions or Native Hawaiian-Serving Institution established in Title III, Part A of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1059d).  Table 3: ANNH Eligible Applicants  Branch Institutions of a State System  For the purpose of this program, the individual branches of a state university system or public system of higher education that are separately accredited as degree granting institutions are treated as separate, individual institutions, eligible to apply for and receive awards, provided that they otherwise satisfy the definition of Alaska Native-Serving Institution or Native Hawaiian-Serving Institution as specified above.  Independent Branch Campuses  Independent branch campuses of individual institutions may apply for and receive grant awards under this program, provided that they otherwise satisfy the definition of Alaska Native-Serving Institution or Native Hawaiian-Serving Institution as specified above. An &#8220;independent branch campus&#8221; means a unit of a 2-year or 4-year institution of higher education that is geographically apart from the main campus, is permanent in nature, offers courses for credit and programs leading to an associate or bachelor&#8217;s degree, and is autonomous to the extent that it has its own faculty and administrative or supervisory organization and its own budgetary and hiring authority.  Collaborative Arrangements  Two or more eligible, individual institutions, independent branch campuses, or branch institutions of a state system may form a collaboration to carry out education, applied research, and extension programs in the food and agricultural sciences. In addition to the individual eligible institutions (or independent branch campuses, etc.), such a collaboration also may include units of State government and private sector entities.  An existing collaboration consisting of at least two or more eligible, individual institutions, independent branch campuses, or branch institutions of a state system, which demonstrates its ability to carry out allowed activities and its commitment to the goals of the ANNH Grants Program, also may apply for and receive a Collaborative Grant.  Certification of Eligibility. Eligibility documentation must be submitted with the application.  At the time of application, each primary applicant will be required to demonstrate or certify that it is an eligible institution under the ANNH Grants Program. If the applicant is a new or existing collaborative project, each member of the collaborative must demonstrate or certify that they are an eligible individual institution, independent branch campus, or a branch institution of a state system.  If an institution has received a &#8220;Designation as an Eligible Institution&#8221; letter for FY 2022 funding under the Title III, Part A, Alaska Native-Serving Institutions Program or the Native Hawaiian- Serving Institutions Program from the U.S. Department of Education, the institution must submit a copy of the letter along with its application to satisfy the demonstration of eligibility requirement.

The solicitation is available by opening the NSPIRES homepage at https://nspires.nasaprs.com/ , selecting &quot;Solicitations,&quot; then selecting &quot;Open,&quot; and, finally, entering &quot;Early Career Faculty (ECF)&#8221; in the Keyword search. The Space Technology Research Grants (STRG) Program within STMD seeks proposals from accredited U.S. universities on behalf of their outstanding new faculty members who intend to develop academic careers related to space technology. Our Nation&#8217;s universities couple fundamental research with education, encouraging a culture of innovation based on the discovery of knowledge. Universities are, therefore, ideally positioned to both conduct fundamental space technology research and diffuse newly found knowledge into society at large through graduate students and industry, government, and other partnerships. STMD investments in space technology research at U.S. universities promote the continued leadership of our universities as an international symbol of the country&apos;s scientific innovation, engineering creativity, and technological skill. These investments also create, fortify, and nurture the talent base of highly skilled engineers, scientists, and technologists to improve America&#8217;s technological and economic competitiveness. The following topics are anticipated for the final appendix: Topic 1 &#8211; Development of Lightweight Solar Sail Attitude Control Technologies Topic 2 &#8211; Hibernation and Recovery of Solar-Powered Systems for Lunar Missions Topic 3 &#8211; Tailorable Composite Design Concepts towards Dimensionally Stable Structures Only accredited U.S. universities are eligible to submit proposals on behalf of their outstanding new faculty members who intend to develop academic careers related to space technology. The PI must be an untenured Assistant Professor on the tenure track at the sponsoring U.S. university at the time of award. The PI must be a U.S. citizen or have lawful status of permanent residency. The PI must be the primary researcher on the effort; Co-Investigators are not permitted. Collaborators (other than NASA civil servants/JPL) are permitted. See the solicitation (Section 3.0) for complete requirements regarding eligibility and for definitions and restrictions regarding collaborators. A PI may submit only one proposal in response to this appendix. NASA encourages submission of ECF proposals on behalf of early career faculty members at all U.S. universities and especially encourages proposals submitted on behalf of women, members of underrepresented minority groups, and persons with disabilities. The financial and programmatic support for ECF comes from the Space Technology Research Grants Program within the Space Technology Mission Directorate. Awards are planned to start in early October 2022. NASA plans to make approximately 6 awards as a result of this ECF solicitation, subject to the receipt of meritorious proposals and the availability of funds. The actual number of awards will depend on the quality of the proposals received; NASA reserves the right to make no awards under this solicitation. All proposals must be submitted electronically through NSPIRES or through Grants.gov (www.grants.gov) by an authorized organizational representative. Notices of Intent are strongly encouraged by March 2, 2022. Proposals are due on or before March 31, 2022. Detailed submission instructions are provided in the solicitation. Potential proposers and their proposing organizations are urged to familiarize themselves with the submission system(s), ensure they are registered in NSPIRES, and submit the required proposal materials well in advance of the deadline. Technical and programmatic comments and questions may be addressed by e-mail to the Space Technology Research Grants Program Executive, Claudia Meyer, at hq-ecf-call@mail.nasa.gov.

State AIS Plans have been transmitted by state governors and then approved by the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force. All state grants will be awarded based on a competitive process for which only Great Lakes states or their designee are eligible. Funding is provided to support implementation of State AIS Plans which helps states in preventing introduction and spread of AIS on state and surrounding lands. State environmental agencies develop the science-based plans and approaches to make sound decisions to prevent the introduction and spread of AIS and adapt to changes in state waters over time. Proposed work must either be within the Great Lakes Basin or near enough to the basin that it contributes substantially to the prevention and/or control of AIS in the Great Lakes basin. Activities such as outreach, boat ramp inspections, and/or law enforcement are often done outside the basin but make substantial contributions when work is done in areas where people are likely to transit (and thereby potentially transfer AIS) into the Great Lakes basin. Early detection, rapid response, and/or control efforts outside the basin must address: &#8226; Species with a substantial potential for interbasin transfer (e.g., hydrilla in a waterbody near the Great Lakes basin that receives heavy boat use). &#8226; Species of significant concern to the Great Lakes community within a Great Lakes state. &#8226; Activities where the primary motivation is the prevent transfer of AIS into the Great Lakes basin.

The mission of GTO is to research, develop, and validate innovative and cost-competitive technologies and tools to locate, access, and develop geothermal resources in the United States, enabling the deployment of carbon-free, flexible geothermal energy in both the electric and non-electric sectors. Geothermal energy is a renewable and diverse energy solution for the United States, providing reliable and flexible electricity generation and delivering unique technology solutions to America&#8217;s heating and cooling demands. Geothermal resources can be found nationwide, are &#8220;always on,&#8221; and represent vast domestic energy potential. Only a fraction of this potential has been realized due to technical and non-technical barriers that constrain industry growth. The U.S. Department of Energy&#8217;s Geothermal Technologies Office&#8217;s GeoVision report concluded that with technology improvements, especially in areas relevant to drilling costs reduction, geothermal power generation could increase 26-fold from today, representing 60 gigawatts-electric (GWe) by 2050. Building a clean and equitable energy economy and addressing the climate crisis is a top priority of the Biden Administration. This FOA will advance the Biden Administration&#8217;s goals (1) to achieve carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035 and (2) to &#8220;deliver an equitable, clean energy future, and put the United States on a path to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide, by no later than 2050&#8220;1 to the benefit of all Americans. The Department of Energy is committed to pushing the frontiers of science and engineering, catalyzing clean energy jobs through research, development, demonstration, and deployment (RDD&amp;D), and ensuring environmental justice and inclusion of underserved communities. This FOA targets technology developments that will provide significant improvements in drilling performance in commercial geothermal settings. The GeoVision Roadmap2 outlines a compilation of technical, economic, and institutional actions that the entire geothermal community, including DOE, industry, and academia must address in order for geothermal technologies to play a larger role in the nation&#8217;s energy mix. A key &#8220;Action Area&#8221; identified in the GeoVision Roadmap and strategic goals for the Hydrothermal Resource Program are highlighted below. GeoVision Key Action 1.3 - Improve geothermal drilling and wellbore integrity: Integrating improved drilling and well-completion technology, better well design and construction materials, improved decision making, and innovative drilling financing can help industry realize better drilling efficiencies and effectiveness. DELIVERABLE(S): New designs and approaches that enhance drilling efficiency and reduce well costs. IMPACT(S): Reduced costs and risks and improved reliability. GTO Hydrothermal Resource Program Strategic Goals: &#191; Expand geothermal energy opportunities throughout United States. &#191; Support research on drilling technologies that increase efficiency, lower costs, and lower risk related to hydrothermal reservoir development. &#191; Accelerate oil &amp; gas technology transfer to address geothermal&#8217;s toughest challenges. The construction of geothermal wells can represent up to 50% of total capital costs for geothermal energy production. Technologies and techniques that can reduce the time needed or the material costs associated with the construction of geothermal wells are key to achieving cost reductions. Furthermore, recent advancements in drill bits, casing, and drilling workflows have achieved significant cost reductions and improvements in wellbore quality in geothermal subsurface settings. Such significant reductions in time and capital requirements, when achieved in a reproducible manner, would represent material progress towards achieving the goals of the GeoVision study. GTO seeks to reduce the financial risk of technologies and techniques not widely deployed in geothermal resource development. Of particular interest are projects focused on advancing geothermal well construction through the development, modification, and/or adaption of technologies and/or techniques that reduce drilling costs in a real-world geothermal field setting. FOA Goal: The ultimate goal of this FOA is a reduction in geothermal well costs. Because drilling costs are highly variable and sensitive to one-off events, average daily drilling penetration rate (e.g. average m/day) is the basis of performance measurement selected in this FOA. This FOA seeks to affect a 25% improvement in geothermal drilling rates by supporting multiple demonstration projects that each target this level of improvement. This metric and performance target will allow for quantitative evaluation of project impacts to support broad deployment of the most successful approaches. To apply to this FOA, Applicants must register with and submit application materials through EERE Exchange (https://eere-exchange.energy.gov), EERE&#8217;s online application portal. The Exchange system enforces hard deadlines for Letter of Intent and Full Application submissions. The APPLY and SUBMIT buttons automatically disable at the defined submission deadlines.

By addressing priorities at the local scale that are relevant across the US, CIVIC is laying the foundation for a broader and more fluid exchange of research and technology capabilities and civic priorities through joint partnerships involving civic stakeholders and the research community. CIVIC funds projects that pilot state-of-the-art solutions over 12 months, following a six-month planning phase, and have the potential for lasting impact in the partnering community as well as the potential to be scaled and implemented in other communities. Building on other stakeholder-engaged research programs such as NSF&#8217;s Smart &amp; Connected Communities program, CIVIC is uniquely designed to enable transition to practice of innovations into communities, as follows: (1) CIVIC flips the community-university dynamic, asking communities to identify civic priorities ripe for innovation and then to partner with researchers to address those priorities; (2) CIVIC focuses on research-centered solutions that are ready for piloting in and with communities on a short timescale, where real-world outcomes can be evaluatedwithin 12 months; (3) CIVIC requires a coalition of civic partners and stakeholders and a multi-disciplinary set of researchers to co-create and execute pilot projects; and (4) CIVIC organizes and fosters nationwide &#8220;communities of practice&#8221; around high-need problem areas that allow for meaningful knowledge sharing and cross-site collaboration during both the pre-development and piloting stages. For this solicitation, civic partnership and engagement activities, communities, and academic and civic partners must be based in the United States or its protectorates. For purposes of clarity, civic partners and stakeholders may include local, state, or tribal government officials; non-profit representatives; community organizers or advocates; community service providers; and/or others working to improve their communities. CIVIC is organized as a two-stage competition withtwo tracks centered around the following topic areas: Track A. Living in a changing climate: pre-disaster action around adaptation, resilience, and mitigation; and Track B. Bridging the gap between essential resources and services &amp; community needs. In Stage 1,approximately 50 Planning Grant awards will be made &#8211; each with a budget of up to $50,000 for six months to undertake planning and team development activities. These include solidifying the team, maturing the project plans, and preparing a well-developed full proposal for submission to Stage 2. Only awardees of Stage 1 proposals will be eligible to submit for Stage 2. In Stage 2,approximately20 Full Awards will be made. These will be selected from Stage 1 award recipients. For Stage 2, proposals will be considered with budgets up to $1,000,000 for up to 12 months. Proposals must describe how the PIs will execute and evaluate their research-centered pilot projects.

Through the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities, USDA will support the production and marketing of climate-smart commodities through a set of pilot projects that provide voluntary incentives through partners to producers and land owners, including early adopters, to: a. implement climate-smart production practices, activities, and systems on working lands, b. measure/quantify, monitor and verify the carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) benefits associated with those practices, and c. develop markets and promote the resulting climate-smart commodities. Grant agreements under this funding opportunity will be with a single entity, i.e., &#8220;partner&#8221;; however, USDA encourages multiple partners to coordinate on projects. A range of public and private entities are eligible to apply, as described in Section C of the Full Announcement which can be found in the Related Documents tab of this opportunity. Proposals must provide a plan to pilot implementation of climate-smart agriculture and/or forestry practices on a large-scale, including meaningful involvement of small or historically underserved producers, consistent with spirit of the Justice40 initiative; a quantification, monitoring, reporting, and verification plan; and a plan to develop markets and promote climate-smart commodities generated as a result of project activities. Funding will be provided through two funding pools. Proposals in the first funding pool (requests for amounts from $5 million to $100 million per proposal) will be large-scale pilot projects that emphasize the greenhouse gas benefits of climate-smart commodity production and include direct, meaningful benefits to a representative cross-section of production agriculture, including small and/or historically underserved producers. Proposals in the second funding pool (requests for amounts from $250,000 to $4,999,999 per proposal) are limited to particularly innovative pilot projects with an emphasis on &#183; enrollment of small and/or underserved producers and/or &#183; monitoring, reporting, and verification activities developed at minority-serving institutions. All projects must be tied to the development of markets and promotion of climate-smart commodities. For the purposes of this funding opportunity, a &#8220;climate-smart commodity&#8221; is an agricultural commodity that is produced using agricultural (farming, ranching, or forestry) practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions or sequester carbon. Markets for climate-smart commodities may include companies or processors sourcing climate-smart commodities to meet internal targets or other supply chain goals, biofuel and renewable energy markets, companies seeking to sell branded consumer products, or other opportunities that could provide a premium or additional revenue for participating producers and land owners. Sufficient incentives to encourage producer participation, as well as, generation of verifiable greenhouse gas reductions and carbon sequestration are critical to project success and will be considered in the evaluation criteria.

The goal of the NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Program, created in 2011 by NSF, is to reduce the time and risk associated with translating promising ideas and technologies from the laboratory to the marketplace, to increase the economic competitiveness of the United States, to encourage collaboration between academia and industry, and to train NSF-funded faculty, students, post-docs, and other researchers in innovation and entrepreneurship skills.The I-Corps Program utilizes experiential learning of customer and industry discovery, coupled with first-hand investigation of industrial problems and processes, to quickly assess the translational potential of inventions. The I-Corps Program is designed to support the commercialization of so-called &quot;deep technologies,&quot; i.e., those based on fundamental discoveries in science and engineering. The I-Corps program addresses the skill and knowledge gap associated with the transformation of promising basic research outcomes into deep technology ventures (DTVs). In the program&apos;s initial phase, I-Corps Nodes and Sites were funded separately to serve as the backbone of the National Innovation Network (NIN). Previous solicitations for NSF I-Corps Nodes and NSF I-Corps Sites have now been archived. A solicitation for a new operational model, the I-Corps Hubs Program, was introduced in 2020 and replaced funding for Nodes and Sites. This revised I-Corps Hubs Solicitation has been informed by feedback received from the community and lessons learned over the first ten years of the I-Corps Program. In 2017, the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA, Public Law 114-329, Sec. 601) formally authorized and directed the expansion of the NSF I-Corps Program. Through this solicitation, NSF seeks to continue to evolve the current structure, in which NSF I-Corps Teams, Nodes, and Sites are funded through separate programs, toward a more integrated operational model capable of sustained operation at the scope and scale required to support the expansion of the NSF I-Corps Program as directed by AICA. In this more integrated model, I-Corps Hubs, comprising a Lead and initially seven Partner institutions, form the operational backbone of the NIN. Each Hub is funded through a single award, and the term &quot;Hub&quot; refers to a consortium of institutions identified in a proposal responding to this solicitation, including the Lead and Partner institutions. The I-Corps Hubs Program will support proposals from former Nodes and Sites (Track 1) and institutions new to I-Corps (Track 2). I-Corps Hubs are consortia of institutions of higher education spanning distinct geographic regions with common goals and challenges to collaborate to provide entrepreneurial training to members of the scientific community (students, postdocs, faculty, and other researchers). These collaborating institutions participate ina Hub to achieve operational excellence and to facilitate interactions with stakeholders in their entrepreneurial and innovation ecosystem. Each Hub has a Lead institution to oversee operational management of the consortium and seven initial Partner institutions that contribute to the success of the Hub objectives, activities, and expected outcomes. A Lead institution may be a current or former I-Corps Node or Site (Track 1), or they may be entirely new to the I-Corps program (Track 2). Hubs are required to add at least one New Partner Institution(NPI)annually.NPIsare institutions of higher education that seek to join an existing Hub.Funding for NPIs will be provided through supplemental funding. NPIs are expected to collaborate with the Hub and demonstrate that the proposed activitiesof the NPI are coordinated with the Hub&#8217;s objectives and expected outcomes. It is expected that a process for Hub Renewals will be announced at a later date and may provide up to five additional years of funding for existing Hubs that are able to demonstrate their regional and national impact on the innovation ecosystem.",Synopsis 2,No,6102022.0,grantsgovsupport@nsf.gov,"If you have any problems linking to this funding announcement, please contact the email address above.",NSF grants.gov support&lt;br/&gt;grantsgovsupport@nsf.gov,http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf22566,NSF Publication 22-566,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, CISE calls on the information, communication, computing and cyberinfrastructure research community to establish a CISE Research Visioning activity (CISE-RV) to facilitate the articulation of compelling long-term research visions and establish multi-directional communication pathways for stakeholders with interest in information, communication, computing and cyberinfrastructure research, including those in academia, industry, government, professional societies, virtual organizations, international entities, and the general public. It is anticipated that through its activities the CISE-RV will strengthen connectivity and increase coordination across these diverse stakeholders and enable rapid and efficient community response to emerging opportunities and areas of national need. The CISE-RV should have representation from academia, industry, professional societies, and other stakeholders in the CISE fields, and should be inclusive of all disciplines including computer science, computer engineering, information sciences, cyberinfrastructure, and related fields. Through its proposed activities, the CISE-RV should provide the information, communication, computing and cyberinfrastructure research community with a sustainable process for identifying future research challenges and enabling the CISE research community to speak with a unified voice.

Acoustic telemetry arrays will be re-deployed similar to the pre-restoration effort and analyses of detection patterns will be evaluated accordingly to provide a robust pre- and post-restoration comparison. In addition, benthic sampling and subsequent analyses will be replicated during the post-restoration phase to evaluate potential changes in habitat condition and macrofaunal composition. Identified project tasks are: 1. Capture, process and telemetry tag late-stage juvenile and adult stage Gulf Sturgeon in the Pearl and/or Pascagoula rivers. Netting will occur during summer and fall months during 2022-2024. 2. Construct, deploy, maintain, and retrieve acoustic telemetry array at Ship Island. The array will be deployed 2022-2027 with the deployment period extending September-June. 3. Download the acoustic array at regular intervals and provide data summaries for upward reporting by ERDC. 4. Work collaboratively with ERDC to analyze data and develop occupancy trends between project phases (pre- and post-restoration) and project zones. Methods: Successful applicants should have expert knowledge of Gulf Sturgeon life history and extensive familiarity and experience with netting and handling of endangered fish species. Netting within riverine habitats and tagging will follow the general guidelines recommended by the USFWS and NOAA. The candidates should have sufficient experience with telemetry-based projects and a record that demonstrates research experience with collecting and analyzing these types of data. In addition, the candidates will secure all necessary permits (state and/or federal) required for conducting the proposed research. The candidates will be required to prepare a Statement of Work and Work Plan regarding the research to be conducted. The candidates will also be required to submit status reports to accompany billing invoices (monthly or quarterly) and one (1) annual report each year of the cooperative agreement to provide updates on data collection and analysis. Deliverables will include written products that address the following: 1. Timing and duration of Gulf Sturgeon occurrences within the Ship Island project area. 2. Occupancy patterns by Gulf Sturgeon in response to habitat changes at Ship Island. 3. Comparative timing and habitat use by Gulf Sturgeon from different natal drainages at Ship Island. 4.

The Strategy for American Leadership in Advanced Manufacturing states that worldwide competition in manufacturing has been dominated in recent decades by the maturation, commoditization, and widespread application of computation in production equipment and logistics, effectively leveling the global technological playing field and placing a premium on low wages and incremental technical improvements.[1]Thenextgeneration of technological competition in manufacturing will be dictated by a combination of the use of computation to ensure the reliable translation of product designs to manufacturing plans;process controls that provide assurances that the execution of those plans will produce products that meet specifications;inventions of new materials, chemicals, devices, systems, processes, machines, and design and work methods;and new social structures and business practices. Fundamental research will be required in robotics, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, chemical conversion processes, materials science, sustainability, education and public policy, and workforce development to lead this global competition. The goal of Future Manufacturing is to support fundamental research and education of a future workforce to overcome scientific, technological, educational, economic, and social barriers in order to catalyze new manufacturing capabilities that do not exist today.Future Manufacturing imagines manufacturing decades into the future. It supports research and education that will enhance U.S. leadership in manufacturing by providing new capabilities for established companies and entrepreneurs, by improving our health, quality of life, and national security, by expanding job opportunities to a diverse STEM workforce, and by reducing the impact of manufacturing on the environment. At the same time, Future Manufacturing enables new manufacturing that will address urgent social challenges arising from climate change, global pandemics and health disparities, social and economic divides, infrastructure deficits of marginalized populations and communities, and environmental sustainability. Future Manufacturing will require creative convergent approaches in science, technology and innovation, empirical validation, and education and workforce development. It will benefit from cross-disciplinary partnerships among scientists, mathematicians, engineers, social and behavioral scientists, and experts in arts and humanities to provide solutions that are equitable and inclusive. Future Manufacturing will require major advances in technologies for the synthesis and production of new materials chemicals, devices, components and systems of assured quality with high yield at reasonable cost. It will require new advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, new cyber infrastructure, new approaches for mathematical and computational modeling, new dynamics and control methodologies, new ways to integrate systems biology, synthetic biology and bioprocessing, and new ways to influence the economy, workforce, human behavior, and society. Among this array of technologies and potential research subjects, three thrust areas have been identified for support in FY 2022 under this solicitation: Future Cyber Manufacturing Research, Future Eco Manufacturing Research, and Future Biomanufacturing Research. This solicitation seeks proposals to perform fundamental research to enable new manufacturing capabilities in one or more of these thrust areas. This solicitation will support the following two award tracks: Future Manufacturing Research Grants (FMRG)- up to $3,000,000 for up to four years; and Future Manufacturing Seed Grants (FMSG)-up to $500,000 for up to two years. Interdisciplinary teams commensurate with the scope of the proposed research, education plan, and budget are required. Proposals must include demonstrated expertise among the team members to carry out the proposed research, education, and workforce development activities. The use of a convergence approach is expected[2].Teams including minority-serving institutions, primarily undergraduate institutions, and community colleges are especially encouraged. The goal of this solicitation is to enable new manufacturing that represents a significant change from current practice. Therefore, proposers responding to this solicitation must include within the Project Description a section titled Enabling Future Manufacturing. Please see &quot;Proposal Preparation Instructions&quot; for additional details. Realization of thebenefitsof the fundamental research supported under this solicitation will require the simultaneous education of a skilled technical workforce that can transition new discoveries into U.S. manufacturing companies. The National Science Board has recently emphasized this perspective in its report, &quot;THE SKLLED TECHNICAL WORKFORCE: Crafting America&apos;s Science and Engineering Enterprise.&quot;[3]Therefore, proposers responding to this solicitation must include a plantoequip students and upskill the workforce to enable Future Manufacturing. Please see &quot;Full Proposal Preparation Instructions&quot; for additional details.

ARPA-E will not provide funding or compensation for any information submitted in response to this RFI, and ARPA-E may use information submitted to this RFI without any attribution to the source. This RFI provides the broader research community with an opportunity to contribute views and opinions regarding the technology and economics of reprocessing facilities. The Advanced Research Projects Agency &#8211;Energy (ARPA&#8208;E) in the U.S. Department of Energy is seeking comments on the draft technical section of a potential future Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) for the CURIE program. This new program would focus on innovative technologies and approaches that will significantly improve the economics of commercial nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities, improve reprocessing material accountancy while decreasing materials attractiveness, and drastically reduce the volume of high-level waste (HLW) requiring permanent disposal. An ARPA-E workshop was held in July 2021 to help identify and refine metrics for this contemplated program; presentations can be found here. Such technological advancements would enable a 1&#162;/kWh fuel cost for a secure 200 MTHM/yr facility that does not generate pure plutonium streams while significantly reducing the volume of high-level waste requiring disposal. ARPA&#8208;E seeks input from experts in the fields of separations chemistry (e.g., solvent extraction, pyroprocessing, halide volatility, etc.); head-end processing (e.g., voloxidation, Kr/Xe capture, etc.); process intensification; material accountancy/online monitoring; project engineering; techno-economic analysis; digital engineering; systems analysis and risk assessment; advanced manufacturing and construction (including modular fabrication); artificial intelligence, machine learning, and digital twins; and sensors, instrumentation, autonomous operation, and robotics.

The purpose of the program is to harness the power of open-source development for the creation of new technology solutions to problems of national and societal importance.Many NSF-funded research projects result in publicly accessible, modifiable, and distributable open-sourced software, hardware or data platforms that catalyze further innovation. In some cases, an open-source product is widely adopted and forms the basis for a self-sustaining open-source ecosystem (OSE) comprises a distributed community of developers and a broad base of users across academia, industry and government. The goal of the POSE program is to fund new OSE managing organizations, each responsible for the creation and maintenance of infrastructure needed for efficient and secure operation of an OSE based around a specific open-source product or class of products. The early and intentional formation of such managing organizations is expected to ensure more secure open-source products, increased coordination of developer contributions, and a more focused route to impactful technologies. The POSE program aims to support managing organizations that will facilitate the creation and growth of sustainable high-impact OSEs around already-developed open-source research products. In particular, POSE constitutes a new pathway to translate research results, akin to the Lab-to-Market Platform that NSF has pioneered over many decades. Whereas programs like the NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps&#8482;), Partnerships for Innovation, and Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR and STTR) represent an integrated set of programs to provide researchers with the capacity to transform their fundamental research into deep technology ventures, POSE is specifically focused on another translational lineage &#8211; supporting translation from research results to OSEs. Importantly, the POSE program is not intended to fund the development of open-source research products, including tools and artifacts. The POSE program is also not intended to fund existing well-resourced open-source communities and ecosystems. Instead, the program aims to fund new managing organizations that catalyze community-driven development and growth of the subject OSEs. The expected outcomes of thePOSE program are (1) to grow the community of researchers who develop and contribute to OSE efforts, and (2) to enable pathways for the development of collaborative OSEsthat could lead to new technology products or services that have broad societal impacts. OSEs can stem from any areas of research supported by NSF. This solicitation seeks two types of proposals, allowing teams to (1) propose specific activities to scope the development of an OSE (Phase I), and (2) develop a sustainable OSE based on a mature open-source product that shows promise both in the ability to meet anemergent societal or national need and to build a community to help develop it (Phase II). Phase I: OSE Scoping Proposals The objectives of Phase I projects are (1) to enable scoping activities that could result in the preparation of Phase II proposals to grow promising research products that are already available in an open-sourced format into a sustainable and robust OSE that will have broad societal impacts, and (2) to provide training to teams interested in building such an OSE. Each Phase I proposal should describe the current context and, to the extent known at the time of the Phase I proposal, the long-term vision and impact of the proposed OSE. The proposals shouldalso includespecific scoping activities that will lead to awell-developedand sustainableplanfor ecosystem discovery, organizational and governance structure, and community building. Phase I proposals are limited to a total budget of $300,000 with durations of up to one year. The Project Description can be up to 7 pages for Phase I proposals. Phase II: OSE Development Proposals The objective of Phase II projects is to support the transition of a promising open-source research product into a sustainable and robust OSE. Each Phase II proposal is expected to include a detailed project plan to support the community-driven and collaborative development and deployment of later-stage successful research tools into operational environments. The proposals must include a community outreach plan that (a) outlines activities to engage the intended contributor community that will help to further develop and maintain the technology,and (b) identifies an intended user community or organizations that will serve as early adopters of the technology. Each Phase II proposal should describe the current context and the long-term vision and impact of the proposed OSE. The proposal should also include awell-developedplan for building an OSE including ecosystem establishment/growth, organizational and governance structure, community building, and sustainability and evaluation plans. Phase II proposals are limited to a total budget of $1,500,000 with durations of up to two years. The Project Description can be up to 15 pages for Phase II proposals.

A key aspect of the SWIFT program, now in its third year, is its focus on effective spectrum utilization and/or coexistence techniques, especially with passive uses, which have received less attention from researchers. Coexistence is when two or more applications use the same frequency band at the same time and/or at the same location, yet do not adversely affect one another. Coexistence is especially difficult when at least one of the spectrum users is passive, i.e., not transmitting any radio frequency (RF) energy. Examples of coexisting systems may include passive and active systems (e.g., radio astronomy and wireless broadband communication systems, or airborne and elevated transmitters such as satellites) or two active systems (e.g., weather radar and Wi-Fi). Example topics include communications at scale such as large-scale MIMO and intelligence surfaces, reconfigurable transceivers, energy efficient and low-power communications, innovative spectrum use and management such as joint communication and sensing, and resilient spectrum sharing, just to name a few. Another topic of interest is the growing challenge of coexistence between ground-based astronomy and large networks of low-Earth orbiting satellites, including sunlight reflections, thermal emissions, and optical/infrared inter-satellite links. As ground-based optical/infrared astronomy continues to advance in sensitivity and breadth of sky coverage, the need to maintain and enhance this capability in an increasingly congested optical/infrared/radio environment will become increasingly acute. Research projects to address these issues may involve innovative satellite technology and designs that take into account satellite constellation requirements (e.g., thermal balance), innovations in astronomical instrumentation or post-processing algorithms, advancements in coordination methodologies (e.g., use of telemetry or orbital information), and other solutions. The goal of these research projects may be the creation of new technology or significant enhancements to existing wireless infrastructure, with an aim to benefit society by improving spectrum utilization and ancillary challenges, beyond mere spectrum efficiency. The SWIFT program encourages collaborative team research that transcends the traditional boundaries of individual disciplines.

The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements.

On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH22ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)&#8221; from that same page.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) &#8211; 2022 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2022. In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates, the full text of the ROSES-2022 solicitation, and the &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot; as a stand-alone document, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022.

On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH22ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview.

Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements.

In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates, the full text of the ROSES-2022 solicitation, and the &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot; as a stand-alone document, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022.

On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH22ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview.

However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods.

In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates, the full text of the ROSES-2022 solicitation, and the &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot; as a stand-alone document, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022. This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH22ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2022 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list.

In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements.

However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods.

Applicants will be notified within five business days upon receiving proposals noting any outstanding reporting issues that need to be addressed. Tribes will then have thirty days to bring these grants into compliance. Proposals from Tribes that have not brought past due reports (e.g., interim or final performance reports, or interim or final financial status reports) up to date in this 30-day period will be found ineligible and excluded from further consideration in the FY 2022 TWG Program cycle.  When an applicant is carrying two or more active TWG projects while applying for another, the Service has an administrative obligation to verify that there are no correctable problems in implementing the existing awards. We will review the reasons why those grants are still open before proceeding with further consideration. Tribes that demonstrate their effective use of TWG Program funds will not be affected. Tribes that have taken no significant action on any one of their two or more preexisting awards will not be considered eligible to apply for new TWG Program funds until the problem is resolved. Possible resolutions might be for the Tribe to demonstrate progress in the agreed-upon activities of an inactive grant, demonstrate that the assertion of &#8220;no action&#8221; is incorrect, or the Tribe may cancel the grant so that the obligated funds may be recovered and made available to other Tribes in the next grant cycle.",DOI-FWS,Fish and Wildlife Service,2142022,6242022.0,2142022,200000.0,10000.0,6000000.0,,Fiscal Year 2022 Tribal Wildlife Grant (TWG) Program,Synopsis 1,No,2282025.0,PAUL_VANRYZIN@FWS.GOV,PAUL_VANRYZIN@FWS.GOV,PAUL VAN RYZIN&lt;br/&gt;PAUL_VANRYZIN@FWS.GOV,,,Electronically submitted applications in GrantSolutions or Grants.gov or applications&#160;emailed to your WSFR Regional Office must be submitted no later than 5:00 p.m.&#160;ET&#160;on the application due date.

In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements.

SUMMARY The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is the public health agency in the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) responsible for ensuring the safety of meat, poultry, and egg products. FSIS ensures food safety through the authorities of the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, and the Egg Products Inspection Act, as well as humane animal handling through the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act. The Office of Public Health Science (OPHS)&#8212;one of many program areas supporting FSIS&#8217; mission&#8212;brings public health leadership to USDA-FSIS to assure the establishment and support of scientifically sound food safety programs. The OPHS Risk Assessment and Analytics Staff (RAAS) conducts scientific risk assessments and develops new analytic methods for assessing risks of biological and chemical hazards in meat, poultry and egg products that inform risk management decisions and risk communication activities. RAAS&#8217; scientific and technical analyses guide, support and enhance FSIS public health goals as they relate to regulatory initiatives, internal policy-making, data collection, research priorities, and the USDA-FSIS food safety goals. FSIS recently announced it will develop a stronger and more comprehensive food safety framework for the control of Salmonella in poultry. Several initiatives are underway to incorporate the latest science, data and laboratory technology into FSIS&#8217;s decision-making to identify ways to control Salmonella in poultry and reduce foodborne illness. FSIS is developing two separate risk assessment models, in chicken and in turkey. These production-to-consumption risk models will estimate reductions in foodborne illness attributed to chicken and to turkey resulting from control of Salmonella. Specifically, the models will predict the impact of: &#183; controlling Salmonella prevalence, levels (enumeration), and subtypes of public health concern pre-harvest and post-harvest, &#183; implementing preharvest controls, post-harvest controls, and combined pre- and post-harvest controls, and &#183; establishing criteria limiting Salmonella prevalence, levels and/or subtypes, or requiring a specified reduction in a relevant indicator organism. Inputs will include prevalence, levels, and subtypes of Salmonella at various points in the production-to-consumption chain, along with pre-harvest and post-harvest production practices. FSIS will be able to use FSIS-generated data for some of the model inputs. Other inputs may be informed by published scientific studies, or expert elicitations. Outputs will include prevalence and levels of Salmonella, and Salmonella subtypes, at other points in the chain and the corresponding predicted public health impact, i.e., reduction in foodborne illnesses, of Salmonella control strategies. In this way, the risk assessment models enable FSIS to assess risk management options. Before any information is released to the public or disseminated to individuals beyond authorized users under the collaborative agreement, the collaborator must submit to USDA draft copies of all papers, publications and/or products to be reviewed, strictly for confidentiality purposes. In addition, USDA will review draft papers, publications and/or products to ensure consistency with the scope of the purposes described above. We encourage applications from multi-disciplinary teams, to ensure we have the broad expertise needed. Applications from minority serving institutions are encouraged. FSIS seeks a collaboration in the following areas: 1) Existing industry data. FSIS is seeking to collaborate with researchers who can gather and analyze data from the chicken and turkey industries. This would include data considered proprietary in nature. FSIS 508 compliance rules must be adhered to when sharing information with FSIS. FSIS considers data generated by producers and processors of poultry potentially useful in developing these production-to-consumption risk models. For FSIS to effectively evaluate risk management options, it is essential to learn more about current prevalence and levels of Salmonella and Salmonella subtypes across the industry, the types of industry practices and food safety controls that are currently being used, and effects of these practices and controls. The following are examples of the types of data that could be useful in developing a production-to-consumption process simulation risk assessment model to assess the effects of FSIS risk management options: a) Preharvest i) Proportion and effectiveness of preharvest controls being used and whether these controls have different effects on different Salmonella subtypes (1) vaccination (2) biosecurity (3) feed (4) water treatments (5) probiotics/prebiotics (6) bird density (7) bedding management (8) waste management (9) other specific Salmonella control strategies on the farm ii) Proportion and types of pre-harvest testing and the results of such testing b) Postharvest i) Effectiveness of postharvest controls and whether these controls vary based on differences in subtypes (1) staging slaughter of more highly contaminated flocks (2) chemical interventions, high-pressure pasteurization, irradiation, ozone, or other treatments (refer to the FSIS Guideline for Controlling Salmonella in Raw Poultry: FSIS-GD-2021-0005 (usda.gov) for additional guidance) ii) Types and results of testing (pathogens, indicator organisms) (1) products (2) frequency (3) serotyping (4) concentrations/levels (5) whole genome sequencing iii) Average monthly volume iv) Line speeds v) Incoming product specifications (1) Aerobic Plate Count (APC) load (2) Salmonella prevalence (3) Salmonella subtype vi) Type of laboratory support (e.g., data from accredited lab or whether AOAC-approved methods were used) vii) Process control indicators &#8211; results and consequences of testing for: (1) APC (2) generic E. coli (3) Salmonella (4) other viii) Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) validation and verification ix) Lotting practices x) Bird characteristics (e.g., age, weight, genotypic resistance to Salmonella enteric colonization) Because controls of levels and/or subtypes of Salmonella are possible risk management options, data related to levels or subtypes of Salmonella are especially important. Collaborators should describe what and how much data they will analyze and how they will summarize the data in a form suitable for use as inputs to the risk assessment models. Data sets should be complete. FSIS encourages submissions from applicants who can provide data that are representative of the industry both geographically and seasonally. Ideally data sets would represent large, small and very small establishments. Additionally, collaborators should describe their relationships with the poultry industry (both chicken and turkey), their previous experience collecting and analyzing data, and how they will ensure that data they collect remain confidential. Specifically, the collaborator may include excerpts of information in its research results for the USDA and/or for disclosure in USDA publications, BUT MAY NOT, under any circumstances: (i) identify any retailer or manufacturer, (ii) disclose any retailer-identifiable or manufacturer-identifiable information, including specific brands or product names and/or (iii) disclose any market share data at the retailer, brand, or item level in any market. FSIS understands that the data may be proprietary or viewed as confidential business information. Pursuant to USDA&apos;s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) regulations (7 CFR 1.1 et seq.), FSIS is responsible for making the determination with regard to the disclosure or nondisclosure of information in agency records that has been submitted by a collaborator. When, in the course of responding to a FOIA request, FSIS cannot readily determine whether the information obtained from a person is confidential business information, the Agency will seek to obtain and carefully consider the views of the submitter of the information and provide the submitter an opportunity to object to any decision to disclose the information. FSIS will protect collaborators&#8217; confidential business information from public disclosure to the extent authorized under FOIA and in conformity with USDA&apos;s FOIA regulations. 2) Dose Response: An important part of the risk assessment models described above is how the dose of Salmonella to which people are exposed affects the probability of their becoming ill. In the past, FSIS has used the dose-response relationship developed by the World Health Organization[1] to predict human illnesses. This dose-response relationship, however, is based on combined information for all Salmonella subtypes, with no information on any subtype-specific dose-response. In order to evaluate risk management options that consider the public health impact of controlling one or more specific Salmonella subtypes in poultry, FSIS seeks assistance developing a dose-response methodology that considers differences in virulence among Salmonella subtypes. Applicants should describe their experience in developing dose-response relationships and describe one or more approaches that account for differences in subtype. The collaborator will be expected to develop one or more methodologies for relating risk of illness to subtype- specific doses of Salmonella.

The FOA and any awards made under this FOA are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on and the development of transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established &#8220;learning curves&#8221; where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive down the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. By contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly lower than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive &#8211; that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development. The Office of Management and Budget defines &#8220;applied research&#8221; as an &#8220;original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge&#8230;directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective&#8221; and defines &#8220;experimental development&#8221; as &#8220;creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.&#8221; (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere.

Program Overview: The goal of the HESTIA program is to support the development of technologies that nullify embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (see Section I.B above), while simultaneously transforming buildings into net carbon storage structures. Specifically, projects funded under the HESTIA Program will develop and demonstrate building materials and whole-building designs that are net carbon negative (see Section I.B above) on a life cycle basis by utilizing atmospheric CO2 or CH4 (see Section I.B above) from a wide range of potential feedstocks (e.g., forestry and purpose-grown products, agricultural residues, marine derived, direct carbon utilization) in the production process. HESTIA metrics are: &#8226; storage of more carbon in the chemical structure of the finished product than emitted during manufacture, construction, and use, &#8226; relevant performance testing (e.g., flammability, strength) as required per applicable building code and incumbent specifications, &#8226; market advantage (e.g., improved material performance in at least one area, lower cost, easier installation) over the best-in-class incumbent building element(s) (i.e. structural and/or enclosure) selected for replacement, and &#8226; sufficient retention of carbon storage over service lifetime and minimized end-of-life emissions where possible by designing for reuse, repurposing, and/or recycling. This FOA supports the development of viable technologies to achieve these metrics in a cost-effective manner to meet building construction industry demand for low-cost. Technical categories of interest are identified in Section I.E of the FOA. Performance targets for the technical categories of interest are provided in Section I.F of the FOA. Section I.G of the FOA provides information on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) requirements. To ensure that the technologies developed through this Program are evaluated consistently and transparently, a separate solicitation will be used to develop and perform Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) in conjunction with and to support Applicants of this FOA. The HESTIA Program offers a unique opportunity to address the growing need for market-ready negative emission technologies to implement carbon removal strategies by changing the paradigm for building construction through the use of carbon negativity as a design parameter. Projects will create novel designs that maximize the energy benefits of carbon storage in addition to manufacturing methods and performance of the materials themselves.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) &#8211; 2022 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2022. In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates, the full text of the ROSES-2022 solicitation, and the &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot; as a stand-alone document, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022. This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH22ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2022 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list.

Thus, this work is additive to the conservation commitments entered into when HCPs are permitted and serves as a meaningful way to leverage non-Federal investment in species recovery and connect conservation lands across the landscape.",Synopsis 1,Yes,,Kelly_Niland@fws.gov,Kelly_Niland@fws.gov,Kelly Niland&lt;br/&gt;Kelly_Niland@fws.gov,,,"This program requires the submission of applications online through GrantSolutions.gov as applicants will receive an acknowledgement of application receipt.&#160; GrantSolutions automatically generates an electronic date and time stamp in the system upon application receipt.

We are the only agency in the federal government whose primary responsibility is the conservation and management of these important natural resources for the American public. The Service&apos;s origins date back to 1871 when Congress established the U.S. Fish Commission to study the decrease in the nation&#8217;s food fishes and recommend ways to reverse that decline. Today, we are a diverse and largely decentralized organization, employing about 8,000 dedicated professionals working out of facilities across the country, including a headquarters office in Falls Church, Virginia, and eight regional offices representing the 12 Unified Interior Regions. The National Infrastructure Partnerships initiative of the US Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) encourages National Wildlife Refuge System field stations to partner with local, regional, and national nonprofit organizations, other land management groups, state and tribal partners, and others to accomplish projects that: (i) promote the stewardship of resources of the refuge through habitat maintenance, restoration, and improvement, biological monitoring, or research; (ii) support the operation and maintenance of the refuge through constructing, operating, maintaining, or improving the facilities and services of the refuge; (iii) increase awareness and understanding of the refuge and the National Wildlife Refuge System through the development, publication, or distribution of educational materials and products; (iv) advance education concerning the purposes of the refuge and the mission of the System through the use of the refuge as an outdoor classroom to combine educational curricula with the personal experiences of students relating to fish, wildlife, and plants and their habitat and to the cultural and historical resources of the refuges and development of other educational programs; (v) promote the understanding of, education relating to, and the conservation of the fish, wildlife, plants, and cultural and historical resources; (vi) improve scientific literacy. The goals of the initiative are to enable local communities to play a more active role in increasing outdoor recreation opportunities on refuge lands and waters, to be more focused and deliberate in using partnerships to help the Service address infrastructure repair and improvement needs such as proactive maintenance and the maintenance backlog, and to enhance wildlife habitat. This initiative will enable the Service to leverage funds and staff resources. Additionally, this initiative can help address multiple Service priorities as a catalyst for: &#8226; Economic and Conservation Enhancement &#8226; Career Training and Mentoring Opportunities for Youth and Adults &#8226; Equity and Inclusion in Conservation and Recreation &#8226; Climate and Wildlife Resilience &#8226; Community Health Successful projects will be research/assessments related to identified Service priorities or infrastructure projects at national wildlife refuges that enhance the visitor experience, promote wildlife-dependent outdoor recreation, provide sustainable wildlife habitat, provide career training and mentoring opportunities, and engage the community in special events and other opportunities to participate in wildlife-dependent outdoor recreation on Service lands and waters. Fish and Wildlife Act &#8211; Community Partnership Enhancement Authority Overview Notwithstanding the Federal Grants and Cooperative Agreements Act, the Fish and Wildlife Act&#8212;Community partnership enhancement (16 U.S.C. 742f(d)) authorizes the Service to enter into cooperative agreements with non-Federal partner entities to implement projects or programs for a refuge or complex of geographically related refuges , including carrying out certain construction projects on refuge property.

To accomplish this, NHTSA awards grants to state and local governments, not-for-profit organizations, and other entities in support of motor vehicles and road traffic safety initiatives.NHTSA is committed to addressing equity in traffic safety, with respect to development and implementation of programs and objectives described in this NOFO consistent with Executive Order 13985: Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government.The purpose of the Cooperative Agreement (CA or Agreement) is to advance traffic safety through the development, demonstration, and evaluation of innovative traffic safety countermeasure approaches and techniques, and innovative and measurable strategies and programs to affect law enforcement engagement. Traffic fatalities are increasing at a significant rate and new traffic safety countermeasures are required to address the rise in fatalities. The Recipient will first develop and demonstrate innovative traffic safety strategies and approaches consistent with existing legislation, that also support the fair and equitable application of countermeasures in communities of color, socio-economically disadvantaged, or locations where enforcement has been ineffective or lacking as a localized priority. The Recipient shall also demonstrate and evaluate approaches, strategies, and methods that enhance law enforcement engagement, as well as public engagement between law enforcement and the communities being served, ensuring that underserved communities are represented. The project will focus on the following:1. Speed management and speeding enforcement.2. Occupant protection, including seat belts and child restraint enforcement. 3. Impaired driving enforcement. 4. Effective engagement between Highway Safety Offices and law enforcementSince 2015, the Nation experienced a significant and sudden increase in the number of highway traffic fatalities after steadily declining to the lowest level in more than 65 years in 2014. In 2015, the Nation experienced a nearly 10 percent increase in traffic deaths and increased to a high point in 2020 at 38,680 fatalities. Improving safety on our Nation&#8217;s roadways and preventing injuries and deaths in traffic crashes remains a top priority for NHTSA. Pursuant to its authority, NHTSA provides highway traffic safety grants to states, territories and local communities, and supports research, demonstration projects, and countermeasure programs designed to prevent motor vehicle crashes and reduce their associated economic costs. The development of new approaches and strategies to influence action by law enforcement to undertake the action necessary to reduce crashes and fatalities has become evident. Existing programs and strategies are not having the desired effect in an environment where fatal crashes are increasing significantly, and societal expectations and changes have challenged law enforcement at the operational and philosophical level. Injuries due to speeding, occupant protection and impaired driving are key components in the surge of fatalities, as well as the disproportional impact on communities of color.

The response provides a unique opportunity to review, evaluate, and recommend strategies to prevent and to rapidly respond to the introduction, establishment, and spread of AIS in the waters of the United States. Accordingly, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS or Service) requests proposals to conduct an assessment and draft an after-action report for the Marimo moss ball incident that is national in scope to evaluate the effectiveness and timeliness of actions taken and provide recommendations for future actions needed to mitigate risk and improve preparedness for response. It is anticipated that the work will be completed through a cooperative agreement with the Service. Service staff will be substantially involved throughout the assessment to provide details about the response, to provide additional points of contact, and access to additional documents that may be needed to adequately assess the moss ball response. However, it is expected that the grantee will draft the report and develop conclusions and recommendations independently. Objectives to be addressed under this assessment include: Establish the timeline of actions taken to respond to the Marimo moss ball incident; Describe the roles and responsibilities of applicable Federal agencies, including interaction with state agencies and industry sectors; Evaluate the working relationship among Federal agencies at ports of entry; Identify potential obstacles to effective import regulation at the Federal level associated with the commerce of aquatic organisms known to be associated with the aquarium, water garden, and pet trade; Evaluate information sharing (timing, mechanisms, and content) between and among the multiple parties (e.g., Federal and State agencies, industry sectors, businesses, public) involved throughout the response; and Identify potential strengths, gaps, and limitations of the Federal response. Following award selection, the successful applicant must provide a draft outline of the report that will be used to communicate the results of the assessment. A Review Team, composed of Service staff and invited subject matter experts will review the draft outline and provide feedback to ensure that all anticipated deliverables will be met. Overall, the report should: Summarize the manner and timing of actions that occurred to respond to the moss ball incident, including those taken by Federal and State agencies, regional organizations, and industry; Identify gaps in regulation, enforcement, and other authorities, commenting on changes that may be needed to prevent similar circumstances; Provide recommendations for actions needed to: Mitigate risk from the aquarium, water garden, and pet trade prior to, at the point of entry, and after entry into U.S. commerce; Improve preparedness for response to AIS introductions; and Address other issues identified through the analysis. Following the completion of the draft outline, the grantee will be required to meet with the Review Team, either in person or virtually, to discuss a defined work plan and identify areas where assistance or information is needed for the assessment. Six months after the agreed upon work plan is implemented, the grantee must provide an accomplishment report (approximately 2 pages) to update the Review Team on the plan&#8217;s progress. Outcomes from this assessment will be directly applicable to preventing species from being introduced into and spreading within the United States with a focus on pathways associated with the commerce of living organisms, including the aquarium, water garden, and pet trade which are identified as high-risk pathways of introduction. Once the assessment is complete, the grantee will be required to present (30 &#8211; 45 minutes, in person or virtually) the findings and recommendations to the Aquatic Nuisance Species (ANS) Task Force.

The FOA and any awards made under this FOA are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on and the development of transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established &#8220;learning curves&#8221; where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive down the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. By contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly lower than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive &#8211; that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development. The Office of Management and Budget defines &#8220;applied research&#8221; as an &#8220;original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge&#8230;directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective&#8221; and defines &#8220;experimental development&#8221; as &#8220;creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.&#8221;1 Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as &#8220;experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts&#8221;)2 should contact the DOE&#8217;s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&amp;D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity). Program Overview: The Mining Innovations for Negative Emissions Resource Recovery (MINER) program&#8217;s aim is to support the development of commercial-ready technologies that give the United States a net-zero or net negative emissions pathway toward increased domestic supplies of copper, nickel, lithium, cobalt, rare earth elements, and other critical elements required for the transition to clean energy. The lack of a secure domestic supply of these minerals poses a significant supply chain risk for the United States, especially with regard to batteries, renewable energy generation, and transmission. Meanwhile, the domestic mining industry faces the rapid depletion of high-profit deposits, increased cost of mining and processing, expensive, management, and accumulation of tailings, resulting in an overall reduced return of investment by conventional mining methods. Consequently, the Advanced Research Projects Agency &#8211; Energy (ARPA&#8211;E) is issuing this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) with objectives to support the development of technology and approaches to: (1) decrease comminution energy by 50% compared to state-of-the-art; (2) increase yield of energy-relevant minerals by reducing unrecovered energy-relevant minerals in the tailings by 50% compared to state-of-the-art; and (3) enabling the negative emissions production of key minerals by sequestering &gt;10 wt.% CO2e per metric ton of ore processed. Four categories have been identified as necessary to achieve these goals and are discussed in detail later: I. Mineral comminution II. Improvements to beneficiation and processing to increase mineral yield III. Carbon negative reactions IV. Sensing, analyzing and enabling carbonation potential and mineralization This FOA supports the development of viable technologies to achieve these goals cost-effectively with the potential to reach commercial scalability.

540,338319,FY 2022 SBIR/STTR Phase II Release 2,DE-FOA-0002572,D,G,ST,,81.049,25.0,Only domestic small business concerns (SBCs) are eligible to submit applications and receive awards under this FOA. Additional eligibility requirements apply to the different Phase II mechanisms as described in the FOA.,PAMS-SC,Office of Science,2282022,4192022.0,2242022,1600000.0,1.0,125000000.0,110.0,"The DOE invites eligible Phase I and Phase II awardees to apply for Phase II awards (grants and cooperative agreements) (initial, second, and third) under this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). Topic descriptions for this FOA can be found on the DOE SBIR/STTR web site at https://science.osti.gov/sbir/Funding-Opportunities. 1. Initial Phase II Awards The purpose of an Initial Phase II award is to perform the research and development (R&amp;D) required to meet the DOE objectives stated in the topic and subtopic of the Phase I FOA. In addition, it is intended that the small business awardee would be in a position to pursue commercial applications of the R&amp;D at the end of Phase II. In many cases, Phase II results in a prototype, product, or a working process that can be demonstrated to a potential investor or customer (either in the private sector or in the Federal government, including the DOE). This FOA is supplemental to the FY 2021 SBIR/STTR Phase I Release 2 FOA (DE-FOA-0002360); therefore, general information already provided in the Phase I FOA also applies to this Phase II process. If a conflict arises between the Phase I FOA and this Phase II FOA, the Phase II FOA will govern. 2. Second Phase II Awards There are two types of DOE Second Phase II awards: Phase IIA: A Phase II awardee may request additional financial support for new R&amp;D tasks and activities that are aligned with the original scope of work for the Phase II award. The purpose of the Phase IIA award is to allow the awardee to complete the R&amp;D associated with initial prototype, product, or process development. The review criteria (see Section V.A.) for Phase IIA applications will be the same as for Initial Phase II awards submitted to this FOA. Only award recipients resulting from the FY 2021 SBIR/STTR Phase II Release 2 FOA (DE-FOA-0002156) under the eligible topics detailed in Section III.A. of this FOA may apply for Phase IIA awards. In addition, Phase IIA applications will only be accepted from Phase II awardees that have an active Phase II award at time of application. Applicants will not be able to resubmit at a later date, if a Phase IIA application is declined for award. Phase IIB: A Phase II awardee may request additional financial support for new R&amp;D tasks and activities that extend beyond the scope of the original Phase II award. The purpose of the Phase IIB award is to assist the awardee in transitioning the innovation towards commercialization. The review criteria for Phase IIB awards (see Section V.A.) will be different from both Initial Phase II and Phase IIA applications submitted to this FOA. The review of Phase IIB applications will place greater emphasis on impact and applicants are expected to demonstrate a well-planned path to commercialization as evidenced in commercialization activities conducted in parallel with or after Phase IIB R&amp;D. Only awardees from the FY 2019 and FY 2020 SBIR/STTR Phase II Release I FOAs (DE-FOA-0001976 and DE-FOA-0002156) under the eligible topics detailed in Section III.A. may apply for Phase IIB awards. A Phase II awardee may submit only one second Phase II application per eligible award as noted above to either Phase IIA or Phase IIB in response to this FOA. Phase IIA or Phase IIB awards may extend the Phase II award for up to two years and the combined Phase II and second Phase II should not exceed four years, unless an unforeseen delay is encountered. 3. Third Phase II Awards (SBIR only) Third SBIR Phase II awards (Phase IIC) continue research and development from a second SBIR Phase II award towards commercialization and require matching funds from a third-party investor. These matching funds can be used for either (1) research and development costs NOT requested in your budget or (2) other costs associated with commercialization of the proposed innovation. In addition, Phase IIC applications will only be accepted from Phase IIA or IIB awardees that have an active Phase IIA or IIB award at time of application.

High Fidelity Radio Frequency Scene Generation for Real-Time Processing NSWC Crane seeks novel approaches to the problem of generating complex radio frequency (RF) scenes for use in real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) simulations. Of particular interest are synthetic RF scenes for navigation purposes such as terrain feature mapping radars, Doppler mapping radars, and object identification purposes within radar scenes generated by pulse-doppler radars and synthetic aperture radars. RF scenes generated by radars such as LIDAR are of interest as well. For HWIL applications, an RF scene is a synthetic scene derived from terrain databases such as Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED), merged with three dimensional objects (scatterers), combined with an aerospace vehicle&#8217;s state (3 dimensional position, orientation, and 3 dimensional velocity), and presented as digital scenes suitable for conversion to RF signals for processing in real time by RF systems on the aerospace vehicle. Scene computation approaches should trade scene resolution and fidelity with computation time and effort for a given computing capability. Novel approaches can include precomputation of scenes given apriority knowledge on an aerospace vehicle&#8217;s state over a given timeframe. Precomputation approaches should focus on minimizing scene computation and storage while preserving the ability to present those scenes in real time to a system under test. Aerospace vehicle expected velocities may range from subsonic to hypersonic speeds. A suitable proposal will address at least one of the areas discussed above and show improvement over current state of the art. b. Validation &amp; Verification for Trusted Autonomous Vehicles NSWC Crane seeks research concerning Validation &amp; Verification (V&amp;V) of autonomous vehicles that utilize Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms. A primary area of exploration involves the evaluation of V&amp;V approaches as they apply to the development of AI &#8220;Trust&#8221; for operational situations. Of particular interest is the use of Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) methods and hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) for pre-mission evaluation of learning integrity. Methods that utilize Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) platforms for AI capability implementation will be of particular interest. Methods that utilize multiple laboratory facilities for federated learning are also of special interest.",Synopsis 1,No,4232022.0,jerry.bean@navy.mil,Work Email,Jerry C Bean &lt;br/&gt;Grantor &lt;br/&gt;Phone 8128546823,,,,,,,,,,,,

Agency Overview: The Advanced Research Projects Agency &#8211; Energy (ARPA-E), an organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), is chartered by Congress in the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69), as amended by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358), as further amended by the Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-260) to: &#8220;(A) to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that&#8212; (i) reduce imports of energy from foreign sources; (ii) reduce energy-related emissions, including greenhouse gases; (iii) improve the energy efficiency of all economic sectors; (iv) provide transformative solutions to improve the management, clean-up, and disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; and (v) improve the resilience, reliability, and security of infrastructure to produce, deliver, and store energy; and (B) to ensure that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.&#8221; ARPA-E issues this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) under its authorizing statute codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 16538. The FOA and any awards made under this FOA are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on and the development of transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established &#8220;learning curves&#8221; where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive down the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. By contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly lower than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive &#8211; that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development. The Office of Management and Budget defines &#8220;applied research&#8221; as an &#8220;original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge&#8230;directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective&#8221; and defines &#8220;experimental development&#8221; as &#8220;creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.&#8221;1 Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as &#8220;experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts&#8221;)2 should contact the DOE&#8217;s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&amp;D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity). Program Overview: The Mining Innovations for Negative Emissions Resource Recovery (MINER) program&#8217;s aim is to support the development of commercial-ready technologies that give the United States a net-zero or net negative emissions pathway toward increased domestic supplies of copper, nickel, lithium, cobalt, rare earth elements, and other critical elements required for the transition to clean energy. The lack of a secure domestic supply of these minerals poses a significant supply chain risk for the United States, especially with regard to batteries, renewable energy generation, and transmission. Meanwhile, the domestic mining industry faces the rapid depletion of high-profit deposits, increased cost of mining and processing, expensive management, and accumulation of tailings, resulting in an overall reduced return of investment by conventional mining methods. Consequently, the Advanced Research Projects Agency &#8211; Energy (ARPA&#8211;E) is issuing this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) with objectives to support the development of technology and approaches to: (1) decrease comminution energy by 50% compared to state-of-the-art; (2) increase yield of energy-relevant minerals by reducing unrecovered energy-relevant minerals in the tailings by 50% compared to state-of-the-art; and (3) enabling the negative emissions production of key minerals by sequestering &gt;10 wt.% CO2e per metric ton of ore processed. Four categories have been identified as necessary to achieve these goals and are discussed in detail later: I. Mineral comminution II. Improvements to beneficiation and processing to increase mineral yield III. Carbon negative reactions IV. Sensing, analyzing and enabling carbonation potential and mineralization This FOA supports the development of viable technologies to achieve these goals cost-effectively with the potential to reach commercial scalability. Identified within this FOA are technical categories of interest in Section I.G. Also provided within this FOA are performance targets for the technical categories of interest in Section I.H.

To advance the study of plant invasion impacts, researchers will analyze 1) how rarity and traits influence the degree to which native plant species are impacted by invaders; 2) how invasions reshape the distribution of functional traits within communities; and 3) how invasions underlie taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic homogenization over space in both space and time, and ask whether invasions underlie homogenization of taxonomic, functions, and phylogenetic diversity. Working with a recently compiled dataset of trait and phylogenetic information for native and nonnative species from 48,000 plots across the US, researchers will use generalized linear mixed models and other approaches to determine how invasion influences community-weighted mean traits. Species invasions can reshape ecological communities, decreasing the abundance of some species while facilitating the success of others. Understanding which species are impacted by invasion can provide a foundation for anticipating the outcomes of novel species interactions under global change. Disproportionate impacts on rare species reduce biodiversity and increase extinction risk, and impacts on common and dissimilar species are more likely to affect ecosystem function and services. The phylogenetic and functional novelty of a non-native species can influence its establishment and abundance, its impacts on recipient species, and the degree to which it alters trait distributions and in turn ecosystem properties. Meta-analyses of invasive plant impacts have highlighted the need to study impacts along gradients of invader abundance and to incorporate species traits. A recently available data compilation will be used to test how the abundances and functional traits of invaders and residents underlie invasion impacts. Products will at least three publications advancing fundamental science and at least one that will address how to manage ecosystem impacts of plant invasions.

The term &quot;homeless&quot; means an individual who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence, and includes an individual who is sharing the housing of other persons due to loss of housing, economic hardship, or a similar reason. An individual who is living in a motel, hotel, trailer park, or campground due to the lack of alternative adequate accommodations are also considered homeless. Persons living in emergency or transitional shelter are also examples of homelessness. Abandoned individuals in a hospital or awaiting foster care placement are also considered homeless. An individual who has a primary nighttime residence that is a public or private place not designed for or ordinarily used as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings, or migratory children (as defined in 20 U.S.C. &#167; 6399) who qualify as homeless under 34 U.S.C. &#167; 12473 because the children are living in circumstances described in this paragraph, are also considered to be homeless. (See 34 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12291(a)(12), 12473(6).) The phrase &quot;in need of transitional housing or other housing assistance&quot; means losing one&#8217;s current housing or otherwise needing housing assistance as a result of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Survivors need not be &quot;homeless&quot; as defined above to be &quot;in need of transitional housing or other housing assistance,&quot; nor do they need to be &quot;fleeing&quot; domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. They do, however, need to be individuals for whom &quot;emergency shelter services or other crisis intervention services are unavailable or insufficient&quot; to be eligible for assistance under the Transitional Housing Program.

Although not required, EDA encourages efforts to reach historically underserved populations and areas, communities of color, women, and other groups facing labor market barriers such as persons with disabilities, disconnected youth, individuals in recovery, individuals with past criminal records, including justice-impacted and reentry participants, individuals participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and Women, Infants and Children (WIC), and veterans and military spouses. [1] A &#8220;quality job&#8221; is defined as a job that exceeds the local prevailing wage for an industry in the region, includes basic benefits (e.g., paid leave, health insurance, retirement/savings plan),and/or is unionized, and helps the employee develop the skills and experiences necessary to advance along a career path. &#8220;Prevailing wage&#8221; is defined by the Department of Labor as &#8220;the average wage paid to similarly employed workers in a specific occupation in the area of intended employment.&#8221; [2] For purposes of this NOFO, EDA defines clusters as geographic concentrations of firms, workers, and industries that do business with each other and have common needs for talent, technology, and infrastructure. Clusters are essentially networks of similar, synergistic, or complementary entities that are engaged in or with a particular industry sector; have active channels for business transactions and communication; share specialized infrastructure, labor markets, and services; and leverage the region&#8217;s unique competitive strengths to stimulate innovation and create jobs.

This RFI is not accepting applications for financial assistance. The purpose of this RFI is solely to solicit input for ARPA-E consideration to inform the possible formulation of future programs. The purpose of this RFI is to solicit input for a potential future ARPA-E research program focused on technologies to improve the resilience, reliability, and security of the medium voltage (MV) electric power distribution system by undergrounding power lines. The goals of this research effort would be to develop 1) reliable and safe construction and installation technologies for underground MV distribution systems that are cost-competitive to constructing overhead systems, 2) technologies for robust health monitoring and predictive maintenance of existing and new underground power distribution systems, and 3) approaches to enable rapid repair with minimal surface disruptions. ARPA-E is seeking information at this time regarding transformative, scalable, and rapidly deployable technologies that could: (a) Reduce the cost of civil works associated with overhead-to-underground conversion or the construction of new underground power lines close to existing buildings and active surface use (e.g. road traffic) while minimizing surface disruption. (b) Construct underground vaults and install conduits in various terrain types and geologic conditions cost-effectively while avoiding damage to existing underground infrastructure such as subways, gas pipes, potable water and sewer pipes, and telecommunication wires. (c) Dramatically reduce errors in the underground cable installation processes where failures are prone to occur (e.g. cable splices, installation of cables). (d) Improve the performance of installed systems with advanced sensing and data tools (e.g. monitoring and analyzing system health, locating point of failure quickly and precisely, detecting and categorizing incipient failures before they cause a catastrophic failure). (e) Repair a point of failure quickly and safely with minimal surface disruption for prompt power restoration in the event of a failure. ARPA-E is interested in learning about the barriers to implementing underground MV distribution systems and technological innovations required to overcome such barriers.

They are of crucial importance for producing goods and services, creating value, providing jobs, and achieving social goals. The Science of Organizations (SoO) program funds basic research that yields a scientific evidence base for improving the design and emergence, development and deployment, and management and ultimate effectiveness of organizations of all kinds. SoO funds research that advances our fundamental understanding of how organizations develop, form and operate. Successful SoO research proposals use scientific methods to develop and refine theories, to empirically test theories and frameworks, and to develop new measures and methods. Funded research is aimed at yielding generalizable insights that are of value to the business practitioner, policy-maker and research communities. SoO welcomes any and all rigorous, scientific approaches that illuminate aspects of organizations as systems of coordination, management and governance. In considering whether a particular project might be a candidate for consideration by SoO, please note: Intellectual perspectives may involve (but are not limited to) organizational theory, behavior, sociology or economics, business policy and strategy, communication sciences, entrepreneurship, human resource management, information sciences, managerial and organizational cognition, operations management, public administration, social or industrial psychology, and technology and innovation management. Phenomena studied may include (but are not limited to) structures, routines, effectiveness, competitiveness, innovation, dynamics, change and evolution.Levels of analysis may include (but are not limited to) organizational, cross-organizational collaborations or relationships, and institutional and can address individuals, groups or teams.Research methods may be qualitative and quantitative and may include (but are not limited to) archival analyses, surveys, simulation studies, experiments, comparative case studies, and network analyses. Consistent with NSF merit review criteria, each SoO proposal should discuss both the intellectual merit and the potential broader impacts of the proposed research. SoO values basic research that has the potential to provide broader societal benefits. However, the majority of space in any proposal will need to be dedicated to the explication of theory, methods, and specific contribution to the evidence base about organizational effectiveness. Projects that aim to implement and subsequently evaluate particular organizational training, effectiveness or change programs, rather than to advance fundamental, generalizable knowledge, are not appropriate for SoO. Researchers who seek to conduct SoO-appropriate research in an industrial site and/or via an industry-university collaboration are invited to also look at the Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaisons with Industry (GOALI) program web site.",Synopsis 29,No,10032025.0,grantsgovsupport@nsf.gov,"If you have any problems linking to this funding announcement, please contact the email address above.",NSF grants.gov support&lt;br/&gt;grantsgovsupport@nsf.gov,http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504696,NSF Program Desccription PD-11-8031,,,,,,,,,,

Program DescriptionProgram PurposeThis funding opportunity is for the Interventional Cooperative Agreement Program (ICAP). Through the ICAP, SSA collaborates with States, private foundations, and other non-federal groups and organizations who have the interest and ability to identify, operate, and partially fund interventional research. The research and interventions under this program will target the increased employment and self-sufficiency of individuals with disabilities, including people of color and underserved communities (whether beneficiaries, applicants, or potential applicants of the Disability Insurance (DI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs); coordinating planning between private and public human services agencies to improve the administration and effectiveness the DI, SSI, and related programs; assisting claimants in underserved communities apply for or appeal decisions on claims for DI and SSI benefits; and conducting outreach to children with disabilities who are potentially eligible to receive SSI.SSA intends the projects to have a project period of up to 5 years, with the first year used to put any necessary data agreements into place, recruit additional partners (including any collaborators including sub-contractors or sub-awardees), and conduct any other implementation planning activities. If the project is able to meet these milestones in the first year, funding will be continued to field and evaluate the project for up to four years.Priority Topics of interestProposals must address goals under at least one of the following priority topics. Proposals should identify the priority topic(s) the proposed intervention(s) will address and explain how the intervention would address the priority topic(s).&#8226; Eliminating the structural barriers in the labor market for people with disabilities and other underserved communities. &#8226; Promoting self-sufficiency by helping people enter, stay in, or return to the labor force, including transition-age youth. &#8226; Coordinating planning between private and public human services agencies to improve the administration and effectiveness the DI, SSI, and related programs. &#8226; Assisting claimants in underserved communities apply for or appeal decisions on claims for DI and SSI benefits; and &#8226; Conducting outreach to children with disabilities who are potentially eligible to receive SSI.II. Award InformationType of AwardSSA expects to award at least two awards totaling up to $3 million (each) in cooperative agreements under this request for applications (RFA). The total amount awarded and the number of awards will be determined based on the strength of the applications received and programmatic and budgetary considerations. SSA reserves the right to determine the number of awards, make no awards, or to make awards for amounts less than the amounts requested by the applicants.Cooperative agreements require close cooperation and coordination between SSA and the awardees. SSA will have substantial involvement in the administration of the cooperative agreement, and SSA&#8217;s input and approval is required before conducting most activities.Award Amount and Period of PerformanceSSA will determine a proposal&#8217;s funding eligibility and level of funding based upon the evidence rating that currently exists for the proposed intervention or would likely be attained for the proposed intervention. SSA will also consider the efficacy (strength) of the proposed intervention. The determination of will be based on the level of causal evidence the chosen study design is likely to produce, as well as any existing causal evidence for the proposed intervention.An intervention for which there is a high level of causal evidence or a high likelihood of generating causal evidence, as identified using the criteria mentioned above, for up to 5 years with a total of up to $3 million from SSA. Feasibility studies, i.e., interventions with no causal evidence or a weak causal design as identified using the criteria mentioned above, may be funded up to $1.5 million. Base year spending (i.e., the spending for the first year of the award) for either study type should be no more than $250,000 or 10% of the total budget, whichever is greater.Applications with budgets including expectations of funding from SSA exceeding the ceiling will be deemed non-responsive and will not be considered. SSA will only consider one application per lead organization. The agreements will have one base year with the option to fund up to four (minimum two) additional years of the project. The one-year base period of each cooperative agreement will support the development of data sharing agreements, project planning, evaluation design, and other administrative aspects of the agreement. If, at the end of the first year, or sooner if the necessary agreements and other planning and administrative aspects are in place, the planning process results in an evaluable project, as determined by SSA, cooperative agreements may be extended for up to four additional years during which the awardee will implement and evaluate the intervention. Proposals must include a discussion of the level of causal evidence the chosen study design is likely to produce, as well as any existing causal evidence for the proposed intervention. We will use the criteria from the Department of Labor&#8217;s Clearinghouse for Labor Evaluation and Research (CLEAR) (https://clear.dol.gov/), the Department of Education&#8217;s What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) ( https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/), the Administration for Children and Families&#8217; Pathways to Work Evidence Clearinghouse ( https://pathwaystowork.acf.hhs.gov/), and other similar clearinghouses to determine the level of each proposal&#8217;s claims of, and likelihood of producing, causal evidence.
